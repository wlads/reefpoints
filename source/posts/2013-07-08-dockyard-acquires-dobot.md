Today I'm very happy to announce that we have acquired local design firm
[Dobot](http://dobotdo.com), its two partners Steven & Logan have joined us full-time.
This is a huge move for DockYard, and a simple one for Dobot (they have
been working out of our office for the past few months so they don't
actually need to move anywhere).

Please see the announcement for [Steven
Trevathan](http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/announcement/2013/07/08/steven-trevathan-is-a-dockyarder.html)
and the announcement for [Logan
Faerber](http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/announcement/2013/07/08/logan-faerber-is-a-dockyarder.html)
