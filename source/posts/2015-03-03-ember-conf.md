* Big thanks to Robert Jackson [@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue)!!!! [Get rwjblue a beer!](http://getrwjblueabeer.com)

## Ember 2014 in Review

* Rapid Release worked great! 6 week release cycle to get new features into everyone's hands.

### HTMLBars

```hbs
<a href={{url}}>
```

instead of

```hbs
<a {{bindAttr href="url"}}> 
```

* Block parameters, faster and lower memory, validation for templates
* Killed metamorphs!
* Improvements to Ember Inspector including Ember Data and promises pane, render performance tab, multiple `<iframe>`s, and redesigned UI, to name a few.

### Ember CLI

* Single install command for Addons, test support, massive performance improvements, and API stubbing, and server proxy (the list goes on!).

### Testing Ecosystem

* handles asynchrony 

### Ember Data

* Relationship syncing, async relationships - built with async loading in mind.
* Adapter Ecosystem

## That was last year, what's next?

* [Versioned Guides](http://guides.emberjs.com) -- live today!
* Next Version of Ember CLI (as of last night)
* Engines
* List View
* <angle-bracket> Components (already in Canary)
* Liquid Fire
* Async and Routable Components
* Ember Data: JSON API support out of the box
* Pagination and Filtering
* Shipping Ember Data 1.0
* 6/12 release date for Ember 2.0, Ember Inspector, Ember CLI, LiquidFire, etc.


# Ember.js Performance by Stefan Penner 
[@stefanpenner](https://github.com/stefanpenner)

* Important choices to make, how to make the right choices?
* Time vs. Space
* Things that are costly in space: closures, objects, non-optimized code, compiled code, excess shape allocations
* In Ember.js, need to do less work, align with primitives

## Mis-alignment #1

Problem: Ember does too much work.

Solution: do less

* Actions up, bindings down, no two-way bindings, explicit data flow
* RIP singleton controllers, explicit lifecycle

## Mis-alignment #2

Problem: `init` and `super` are hard to learn and mis-aligned with ES2015

Solution: Embrace super

* Explicit defaults in super
* Don't set properties until super
* When to call `_super()`: When overwriting a framework method before touching `this`

## Mis-alignment #3

Problem: Ember.Object.reopen, buggy, complex internals, massive allocations & shapes

Solution: Limit reopen to before first instantiation

* Meta is a good thing. Every class has a meta, every instance has a meta. Metas for instances are what kill us. Meta is "live" inheriting. If can limit reopen, can make all metas one shape.
* meta.listeners is crazier
* Solution: work with V8 to make things better


# Designing for Ember Apps by Steve Trevathan
[@strevat](https://twitter.com/strevat)

* Mental models: Understand where the user is coming from and what kinds of interactions they deal with
    * "What I think the thing is"
    * Influenced by experiences from the past
    * Not always solid: can be updated and changed. (improvements)
* 2 types of mental models
    * Macro: what I think it is from a distance.
    * Micro: how I think each individual interaction works; the specific feature.
* Build a framework of understanding
    * Some apps are just too complicated
    * Use explicitly if they apply
    * Break mental models if it improves the experience


## Design Patterns

### #1 Gradual Engagement

* Core value given for free. Eventually you may be asked to sign up.

### #2 Skeleton UI 

* ex. Google maps: grid becomes fully rendered map.

### #3 Carry Context

* ex. rdio: music played on laptop is reflected on iPad (or other devices). 

### #4 Reuse Core Interactions

* ex. Browsing Pinterest: provides click and follow tangent.
* Micro becomes Macro; core interactions become a symbol of your app.
* "When I go home and think of your app, I think of the experience, the micro features more than the macro ones."

### #5 Offline Mode

* ex. Google Docs: “trying connect” message and can’t interact with document. Incredibly Frustrating.

## Tools of the Trade

 * A free design pattern library for Ember apps. [Sign up!!](http://toolsofthetrade.dockyard.com)


# Hijaking Hacker News with Ember.js by Godfrey Chan
[@chancancode](https://github.com/chancancode)

* Being a canadian is awesome

## [Hijacking Hacker News App](https://github.com/chancancode/hn-reader)

* Browser extension that transforms old site design to new, more usable app
* Runs in hacker news domain

### Getting the Data

* `$.get("/news').then()`: request html page, extract data, then manipulate
* Hacker News HTML Scrapper: need adapter to help talk to Ember Data store; customize adapter and serializer.

### Fixing the URLs

* Hacker News urls are not ideal for building an Ember app.
* HN urls (serialized App States) to Ember Router (Actual App States)
   * trick Ember into seeing URLs that are different from what is in the address bar
* Router location types: `Ember.HistoryLocation` vs. `Ember.HashLocation`
   * Can use same mechanism to make a custom Ember.Location: `App.HackerNewsLocation = Ember.Location.extend()`

### Preferences

* Changing preferences in one place and can see changes reflected in other
	* Use observer pattern

### The Possibilities

* What if your ideas do not line up with the framework's choices?
* If the frameworks is doing it's job, than the possibilities should be endless!


# The Art of Ember App Deployment by Luke Melia
[@lukemelia](https://github.com/lukemelia)

* Need to adjust deployment techniques from "server app" days
* When traffic starts routing to the new app, finger-printed assets can no longer be accessed
	* Need to keep old and new finger printed assets for a few minutes after a deploy.

## Versioning

* Learn from native apps - phones run different versions of an app
* Keep API working for older clients through API versioning

## Deployment & serving strategy

* HTML page should be managed and deployed as part of static asset deployment process
* HTML page should be served by the API server
* Preview before activating
* A/B Testing
	* Setting global flags based on A/B buckets
	* Serving up wholly different HTML based on A/B bucket
* Notify connected clients

## The New [`ember-cli-deploy`](github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-deploy)

* Merged these three projects: `ember-deploy`, `front-end-builds`, `ember-cli-deploy`
* Now, one project with 6 maintainers (and growing!)

### Roadmap

* Release 0.4.0 by the end of this week!
* Reelease 0.5.0 
	* New pipeline hooks and plugins architecture
	* Includes post-deploy hook
	* Documentation for plugin developers
	* `ember-cli-front-end-builds` becomes a plugin
	* USAGE: `ember deploy staging`
* Beyond 0.5.0: deployment to named buckets, support A/B tests, beta testing, etc.


# Ambitious UX for Ambitious Apps by Lauren Tan
[@poteto](https://github.com/poteto)

Good Design is:

	* how it works
	* reactive
	* playful
	* informative
	
* Designing the product vs. designing the experience
* You are not the same as your website users

## Good Design is Reactive

 * Instant feeback
 * Flow of data and maintaining relationships between that data
 * Ember allows reactivity through the observer pattern
 
### The Observer Pattern

* Computed properties transform properties and keep relationships in sync
* Computed Property Macros to keep things DRY.
	* Ember ships with a bunch of these out of the box (map, mapBy, concat, etc)
* Observers synchronously invoked when dependent properties change

## Good design is playful

* Has personality
* Ex. Slack when you open app (fun messages)

## Good Design is Informative

* Visibility of System Status
	* Jakob Nielson - 10 heuristics for User Interface Design
* Ex. Flash messages
	* [`ember-cli-flash`](https://github.com/poteto/ember-cli-flash)

## Good Design is Intuitive

* Drag and drop (trello, Google Calendar, etc...)
* Ember handles drag and drop events out of the box
	* add `draggable=true` to any html element to make it draggable


# Bring Sanity to Frontend Infastructure with Ember by Sam Selikoff
[@samselikoff](https://github.com/samselikoff)

## How Ember Can Help Today:

* Ember and Ember CLI helps infastructure by reducing boilerplate
* Similar directory structure and architecture
* Conventions: eliminate trivial differences that hold us back
* Writing add-ons for shareable code. Allows us to build structure.
* Use `ember deploy` to deploy apps. Auth and backend config work into separate deploy server.
* Testing in Ember using `ember test`. QUnit provides helpers.
* Identify redundancies and abstractions

## How Ember Can Help Tomorrow:

* Semantic versioning and CLI conventions
* Flexibility
* New standards and best practices
	* generally, shared solutions/frameworks help identify and discover ways of improving applications
	* Ember always keeps up to date with these best practices
* “Ember is not just a framework, it’s a philosophy” of how to create and improve software
	* First, give real developers the tools to tinker
	* Then, deliberately fold in shared solutions

In summary, innovate & share!


# Dynamic Graphic Composition In Ember by Chris Henn
[@chnn](https://github.com/chnn)

## Spliting a Statistical Graphic into Parts

* Splitting a problem allows us to change one feature of the graphic at a time
* Suggests the aspects of a plot that are possible to change
* Encourages custom visualizations for every data situation
* Demo: [Scatterplot example](https://github.com/chnn/composing-graphics)
	*  Adds multiple regression lines (in example, based on # of cylinders of each car)

    	```hbs
    	{{#each subset as |subset|}}
          // component
      	{{/each}}
      	```
     * Each point in the graph is an svg circle

### Grammer of Graphics by Hadley Wickham
(Book of guidlines to follow)

* Data to Aesthetic Mappings
* Scales: one per Asthetic mapping
	* Each data to aesthetic mapping has some mapping function
	* he has chosen to represent these as points in scatterplot example
* Layers: geom, stat, optional data to aesthetic mapping
* Coordinate System
* Faceting

### What does this look like using Ember?

* Data to Aesthetics = outer layer component which takes in the data as params
* Scales = computed properties (using computer property macros)
* Layers = looks like top level component, but must pass the scales

### Further Considerations

* Interactivity
* Animations and transitions
	* performance (updating graphic many times per second)


# Test-Driven Development By Example by Toran Billups
[@toranb](https://github.com/toranbn)

Live coding!!

 * Red, green, refactor
 	* You get a lot of feedback from red (so it can be red, red, red, green, refactor)
 * Incorrect selector in template to make sure you’re doing it correctly (aka. test should fail)
 * Test should not be very layout dependent
 	* Should be more general and not break whenever you make template changes that do not change app functionality.
 * Test names should be descriptive
 * Testing computed properties is recommended because of how caching works with them. Failing test will let you know which properties should be observed in order to break the cache.
 * Design proof testing
