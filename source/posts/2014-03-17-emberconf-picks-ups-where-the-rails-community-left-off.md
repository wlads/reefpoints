I'm writing this on my flight from Portland back to Boston. On this
plane I count at least 12 other attendees of the first [Ember Conference](http://emberconf.com).
A lot has been said about Ember in the past year but if this conference
was any indicator big things are happening and even bigger things are
going to happen.

For me, the biggest take away from any conference is the people and
this conference was no exception. In fact, Ember Conf is now my gold
standard for a technology event. The only possible comparison I have is
how early Rails Confs felt. There is an energy and a scary amount of
creativity happening in the Ember community right now. Much like the
community felt around Rails back in 2006 - 2009 there is the
understanding that those doing Ember now are going to be shaping the
future of the web. Whether that is setting the bar higher for how users
will want to consume web applications in the future or being a large
influence on what the future of the web standards themselves will be, Ember
is the only web technology today that is positioned in the same place
that I feel Rails was years ago. We are the rebels. We are the
counter-culture. Ember is the future.

But, we're learning from the mistakes of the past. Where the Rails
community was the counter-culture of its time it suffered from a male
(and very juvenile) dominated culture. This culture was the result of
the "RockStar" mentality set forth by its leader(s). Ember, in contrast,
began its very first conference with Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale addressing
the entire crowd with their desire for Ember to be an open and diverse
community.

The conference was very well organized, big shoutout to Leah Silber at Tilde. She
put on a great conference, I'm proud that my company had the opportunity
to help make it happen.

From a technology perspective **huge** things are on the horizon for
Ember. If you have been on the cusp of getting involved you will be
kicking yourself later for not doing so now. If you are already building
in Ember nearly all of the pain-points that have existed will be
addressed in the next 6 months. Testing as a first class citizen,
fastest template rendering of any JavaScript framework/tool out there,
animation support, query params, a standardized project structure and
build tool, and there was even talk of how we're going to package and
distribute dependencies. Ember Conf was a continuous roll of one great
talk after another loaded with the best tech on the web. I've already
really enjoyed writing Ember apps for the past year, the next year will
be amazing.

I realize at this point the article smacks of cheerleading optimism. How
can it be this good? The real secret weapon of any open source software
is its community. After this week I can tell you that I have not felt
this way about a community since the early days of Rails. There is
something very special happening here. It isn't just me. [Go search
