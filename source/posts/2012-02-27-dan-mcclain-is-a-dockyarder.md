![Dan McClain](/images/dan-mcclain.png)

Today I'm happy to announce that Dan McClain is joining our team! I've
gotten to know Dan over the past few months through
[BostonRB](http://bostonrb.org). He's been [building out some features for
the BostonRB site](https://github.com/bostonrb/bostonrb/commits/master?author=danmcclain), specifically adding
the start of an admin interface (which is huge for me as I was doing all
data entry through the Rails console) and setting BostonRB up on
[TravisCI](http://travis-ci.org/#!/bostonrb/bostonrb).

For the past few weeks Dan has been working as a contract-to-hire for
us. Already he's made a big impact by setting up a company instance
of Jenkins and keeping us honest with our test suites.

Welcome aboard Dan!
