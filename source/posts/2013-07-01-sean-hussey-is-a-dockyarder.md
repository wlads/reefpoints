![Sean Hussey](/images/hussey.png)
Today is the first day for Sean Hussey at DockYard. He has been
contracting with us for the past few months and I was finally able to
lock him down recently. Sean and I have known one another for years as
he hired me for my first Ruby job at
[RakutenUSA](http://global.rakuten.com/en/). He brings years of Sr.
level Ruby experience to our team.
