If you have an existing app, and are looking for a server component,
whether it be adding a syncing service to your app, building out a web
version to extend your user experience, or need a site to showcase your
app, we have both the design and development resources to make that
happen.

You might have realized that iCloud doesn't fit your needs, or you want
a web application that interacts with your app. We can build your API to
fit your exact needs, so you don't need to fight iCloud to fit your
needs. You may be looking to build out a new RSS service that needs to
parse and cache RSS feeds. We have the experience and resources that
will help you bring a server heavy component to your app.

You may have users looking to use your application when they aren't on
their phone. We can design and build a rich web application that brings your
app to the browser without losing the spirit of your app. You might need
a marketing site with video demos and screenshots of your app. We can
design and build a site that really shows off your application.


If any of these sound like you, you should [get in touch with
us](http://dockyard.com/hire-us).
