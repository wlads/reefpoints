![Robert Jackson](/images/rjackson.jpg)
Today is Robert Jackson's first day at DockYard. Robert is joining our
team as a Sr. Rails and Sr. Ember developer by way of Florida (but he'll
soon be joining us in the Northeast). Robert is a member of the Ember
Release Management Team and has been saving my ass with several of our
open source Ember projects over the past few months.
