I'm very happy to announce that Mike Sager has joined DockYard! Sager
and I met while working on The Campaign That Shall Not Be Named (it was
a very "special" one in MA) we kept in touch on and off after that until
we recently worked together on a project for the AFL-CIO.

Sager brings an intimate knowledge of the progressive political tech
arena. DockYard is already making a great name for itself with political
tech and NPOs and we're looking forward to the klout that Sager will
bring to the table.

While not yet "official" we will soon be opening an office in
Washington, DC. Sager and Chris Gill will be running this office and we
are looking to hire Rails developers that have experience building apps
in politics. [Join us!](mailto:contact@dockyard.com)
