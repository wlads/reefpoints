Romina was a DockYard intern that we just recently hired to full-time!
Over the past few months Romina has taken on all of the challenges we've
thrown at her and excelled. Now she's TDD'ing, Vim'ing, Tmux'ing,
Ember'ing with the best of them. She's also the co-author of the
exciting new Ember application that is all the buzz: [Pizza
Time](http://pizza-time.herokuapp.com)
