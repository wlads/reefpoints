Over the past three years DockYard has primarily taken on "greenfield"
projects, where we are responsible for building applications from
scratch through design, development, and launch. Starting today we're
adding Ember.js Staff Augmentation to the services we provide to our
clients.

If you are looking to add an Ember.js expert to help your team you
should contact us. Our entire engineering team is extremely experienced
in Ember.js application development, Ember.js best practices, and Ember.js Test Driven
Development. We can help your team finish existing features, guide
your team on how to properly build an Ember.js application, and help you
hit your delivery deadline.
