Along with his other fellow Dobot-er we welcome Logan Faerber to the
DockYard team today!

Logan is a [kick ass illustrator](http://www.loganfaerber.com/) who
has done work for New York Life, Dynamo Labs, CareShare, CustomMade,
[Bioware](http://www.biowarestore.com/garrus-screenprint-poster.html),
and [Archaia](http://www.archaia.com/archaia-titles/hawken-genesis/).

Logan has been working out of our office for the last few months and we
are excited to have his unique talents at DockYard.
