A couple weeks ago, Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale of [Tilde](http://tilde.io) ran
their 3-day [Introduction to Ember.js Training](http://www.tilde.io/training/)
at [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com/) here in Boston. I, along with Amanda,
Doug and Chris, attended the training.

## Format

Throughout the training, attendees where building a simplified Rdio/Spotify clone
using Ember. It was broken up into a series of exercises, which built
upon each other. The exercise were test driven, each having set of QUnit tests that defined the
exercise. Before each exercise, Tom and Yehuda would explain and demo
the concepts via slides and JSBin.

### Day 1

Day 1 was spent outlining the core concepts of
[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) and Ember. We
started with Handlebars, which is what Ember uses as its templating
language. After covering the basics of Handlebars, we learned about how
[Ember handles routing and outlets](http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/).
After we finished routing, we moved onto creating Handlebars helper
functions.

### Day 2
On day 2, we started off with
[Ember controllers](http://emberjs.com/guides/controllers/) and how they
serve as proxy objects for the model of your current resource. After
controllers, we covered
[computed properties](http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/computed-properties/).
[Views](http://emberjs.com/guides/views/) followed computed properties,
then we wrapted up the day with creating custom controls with Ember and
Handlebars.

### Day 3

Once we had built the majority of the app, we had a couple more
exercises that built upon all the exercise we had completed. Tom and
Yehuda also went over how we would use
[Ajax requests to pull in data from a remote source with Promises](http://eviltrout.com/2013/03/23/ember-without-data.html).
After wrapping up the remainder of the exercises, we covered how the
[Ember Run Loop works](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13597869/what-is-ember-runloop-and-how-does-it-work),
and discussed approaches to testing Ember applications.

## Feedback

Yehuda and Tom provided a great balance of not-to-dense information,
useful demos and exercises. They did a great job of, what Tom stated as,
"Providing a sufficient level of confusion" in the exercises. Before
each exercise, they would provide all the information needed for the
exercise, but would not give you a list of steps to complete the task.
You may stuggle a bit, but they answer any questions you would
have during the exercise. This would help the attendees actually learn
the concepts, rather than just copy/paste a set of code and modify it
here and there and have it work. I, personally, felt that this worked
really well.

I have worked on a couple side project with Ember before taking this
training, and had a very shallow understanding of some of the concepts.
Coming out of this training, I feel I have a great place to start build
Ember apps. I really fleshed out my understanding of Ember and am really
excited about the technology. I am planning on using it for
any upcoming side projects, to really explore it further.
