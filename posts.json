It is very good that this is important to people as we need\nnew software developers. However, I have noticed that many of these\ndevelopers are finding it difficult advancing beyond beginner. This\nis especially evident when they are taken out of their current\ndevelopment environment.</p>\n\n<p>Beginners require guidance and a set of rules to follow. This has been\nshown time over time to be an effective strategy for learning. The\nrules/principles/laws, whatever you want to call them, are based upon\nthe experience of more advanced developers that essentially boil down to \n&quot;here is what you want to do <em>most</em> of the time&quot;. They are a great\nsubstitute for experience. They also fit in very nicely with the notion\nof <strong>Convention Over Configuration</strong>. But unless you are stepping\noutside of your framework the advantage of COC may turn into a career\nhindering disadvantage.</p>\n\n<p>I am a big fan of Convention Over Configuration. I was first exposed to\nit with Ruby on Rails and I like that Ember.js has been\nfollowing this path as well. However, I also believe that it can become\na crutch for beginners. The rules that they are following coupled with\nthe low friction environment of COC leads to a developer experience that\ndoes not present too many obstacles to be overcome. Learning requires\nchallenge. You meet a challenge, you learn how to overcome that\nchallenge, you move on and now that experience is a tool you can wield in\nthe future.</p>\n\n<p>The market being flooded with beginners along with COC frameworks should\nproduce an environment that is heavily favored towards employers. (buyer&#39;s market) \nIn most cases these developers will be\nable to accomplish most of what a very experienced developer can\naccomplish. This is great for the company&#39;s bottom line but not so good\nfor the individual developer&#39;s own career growth.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, if you are interested in advancing beyond being a beginner,\nyou must get out of your comfort zone. This is going to require you to\nput more time into your craft than your job necessarily allows. Try new\nsoftware languages, try old software languages. Go read\n<a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/\">SICP</a>. Attend meetups, <a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love\">read\npapers</a>,\ncontribute to open source. <em>Contribute to open source even if you think\nyour PR won&#39;t be accepted</em>. All of these things will take you out of the\ncomfort zone that your daily work gives you, but you&#39;ll grow and become\na better (and more in demand) developer for it.</p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["opinion"],"date":"2015-04-10T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/04/09/the-importance-of-being-experience-first","title":"The Importance of Being Experience First","dockyarder":"lauren-tan","body":"<p>We&#39;re in the middle of a digital renaissance that has software eating the world.\nLike the industrial revolution, the digital revolution might see us eventually\nbecoming obsolete, but that&#39;s okay because that&#39;s what progress looks like. To\nstay relevant, we need to place the Experience First.</p>\n\n<h2>The architects of the digital world</h2>\n\n<p>The modern architect has her roots in ancient and medieval history. They\noriginated as artisans; master craftsmen such as stone masons and carpenters.\nIn ancient times, there was no clear separation between the role of the\narchitect and the engineer \u2013 they were seen as one and the same.</p>\n\n<p>In some ways, the architects of the digital world are similar to those of the\nphysical. There are many parallels between the two, although it&#39;s important to\nbe aware of leaky abstractions, and that they are only <em>similar</em>, not exactly\nthe same.</p>\n\n<h2>The craftsmens&#39; renaissance</h2>\n\n<p>We&#39;re currently living in an age of digital renaissance.\n<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460\">Software is eating the world</a>,\nand some of us believe that we&#39;re right in the middle of a great technological\nrevolution \u2013 the software revolution.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s no longer enough to build a good product or service. The world demands\nexcellence, because good is the new average.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe it&#39;s partly a symptom of how efficient manufacturing has become, that\nwe&#39;re experiencing wide scale <a href=\"http://www.rushkoff.com/blog/2005/9/4/commodified-vs-commoditized.html\">commoditization</a>\nof goods and services that were historically considered luxuries. Because of\nthis, we&#39;re also at the start of a new renaissance \u2013 one in which there is a\nresurgence of an appreciation for <a href=\"http://www.launch.co/blog/the-age-of-excellence.html/\">well designed experiences</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"http://confreaks.tv/videos/emberconf2015-ambitious-ux-for-ambitious-apps\">EmberConf talk</a>,\nI defined design to mean more than aesthetics; design is how\nthings work, and encompasses the <em>entire experience</em> across different mediums.\nAirbnb calls this being <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/01/airbnbs-new-head-design-believes-design-led-companies-dont-work/\">Experience First</a>,\nas opposed to Design First, which suggests that anyone who isn&#39;t a designer has\ntheir contributions take a backseat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;That experience is essentially a story, a narrative which ultimately enjoins\nus to a brand.&quot; \u2013 <a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2013/10/22/square-airbnb-and-why-experience-really-is-design/\">Om Malik, Gigaom</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, it\u2019s obvious that we place value on things that fulfill both\nform and function. The popularity of beautiful user experiences, both online and\noffline, are the expression of a digital renaissance that is only going to\ncontinue growing.</p>\n\n<h2>The rise of website builders and what it means for us</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike classical portrait painters, bowling alley pinsetters and other\njobs that have become redundant, the digital creator seems to be relatively\nsafe.</p>\n\n<p>With the rise of website builders like <a href=\"https://thegrid.io/\">Wix</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.squarespace.com/\">Squarespace</a>, <a href=\"https://thegrid.io\">The Grid</a> and\nportfolio/shop builders like <a href=\"http://www.shopify.com/\">Shopify</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/\">BigCommerce</a> and <a href=\"http://virb.com/\">Virb</a> though,\nit&#39;s easier than ever for an individual or business to get a beautiful looking\nwebsite created at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of the web is that once an asset has been made, it effectively costs\nnothing to clone. A designer with a copy of Sketch or Photoshop can very quickly\ndesign a &#39;theme&#39;, have it converted into HTML/CSS by a &quot;PSD to HTML&quot; service\n(as they&#39;re commonly known), and then sell it on one of these site builders.\nYou could very easily get a beautiful looking website setup and live on the web\non Squarespace for less than $10 a month.</p>\n\n<h2>Why you need to place the Experience First</h2>\n\n<p>One thing I&#39;ve learned from my time in Business School, is that humans\n<a href=\"http://freakonomics.com/2011/06/30/the-folly-of-prediction-full-transcript/\">suck at predicting things</a>.\nMaybe we&#39;re all going to be made redundant, but the ones that design the\nbest experiences will continue to be more relevant than ever.</p>\n\n<p>If creating a website or app is commoditized, so be it. After all, who&#39;s going\nto design and build the website builder? The fact is, designing a beautiful\nexperience across different mediums will never be automated, not until we\nhave the technology to build incredibly intelligent Sentient AIs. But by then,\nwe&#39;d all <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209764/\">be in trouble</a>, so I wouldn&#39;t\nworry about it just yet.</p>\n\n<p>Because it&#39;s easier than ever to build a website or app, the experience matters\nmore than ever as the way to differentiate your product or service from the\naverage. When you look to hire a developer or consultancy today, I think it&#39;s\nimportant that you seek out the ones that have honed the balance between design\nand engineering, and have spent time thinking about designing truly delightful\nonline (and offline) experiences.</p>\n\n<h2>Lauren is a DockYarder</h2>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve had a very diverse and varied experience with the web \u2013 I went to design\nschool, did a finance degree, and started a <a href=\"http://www.thepricegeek.com\">company</a>.\nRecently, I made the exhausting move from halfway across the world in Australia\nto join DockYard, because we truly care about the entire experience.

I started with Basic,\nfound my way to C++, and spent two years writing Assembly (MASM). Then I\nfound Ruby. Ruby completely changed everything for me. I loved Ruby. I\nloved Ruby for a reason that many &quot;elite&quot; programmers tend to dismiss:\nthe syntax.</p>\n\n<p>You see, syntax is very important to me. Call it what you will,\nbikeshedding, OCD, stupidity. I care about syntax. It matters to me, and\nwith Ruby I found a community that shared my thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>When Go and Rust came along I was disappointed. Clearly these two\nlanguages were superior in performance (and in many other areas) but were a syntactic step back\nfrom Ruby. What was their reason? Clearly Ruby, and even Python, have\nproven that the masses are attracted by clear and readable syntax. New\nlanguages should take the best of what is currently available and\nimprove upon them. Go seems to target the C/C++ audience, whereas Rust\nseems to attract JavaScript developers. So I guess this becomes a matter\nof perspective and opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Elixir is different. I put Elixir up there with Go and Rust as part of\nthe three new languages that will define the next decade of backend\nsoftware development. With Elixir I found a language that embraced\nRuby-like syntax, but also gave me much more.</p>\n\n<p>The syntax is only skin deep, but this is part of allure of Elixir. It\nis my foot in the door. When I first saw Elixir code I thought to myself\n&quot;OK, this is something I can wrap my head around&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I think a lot of Ruby developers will find their way to Elixir. It seems\nthat many were attracted to Go but I suspect when they start to explore\nwhat the Elixir language has to offer they&#39;ll see the benefits.</p>\n\n<p>But a language needs more than just a hook, there has to be a compelling\nreason to stay. For me that was Functional Programming.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that Functional Programming is making a come back. Every day\nthere is a new blog article on why you should start writing Functional\ncode. Let&#39;s break this down into a few points:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Scalability</h2>\n\n<p>This is an Erlang trait. Elixir apps will attempt to make the best use\nof all the cores in your CPU as possible. Compared to Ruby this is a big\ndeal. We don&#39;t have to write anything special, the Erlang VM (BEAM) just\nhandles this for us automatically. This means we are efficiently using\nour hardware. This type of approach didn&#39;t make a lot of sense a few\nyears ago, multi-core CPUs were expensive. Now they&#39;re cheap and Elixir\nbenefits.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Memory</h2>\n\n<p>Elixir programs are meant to be broken into many different processes.\nThe garbage collection strategy being used isn&#39;t revolutionary but\nbecause we are dealing with <strong>many</strong> runtimes instead of just one the\nimpact on GC is negligible. In addition, you can picture how short-lived\nprocesses might be the equivalent of objects in an OOP lanuage. We pass\nmessages into the process and get back a value. Each process manages its\nown memory, if the process is short-lived enough GC is never even run\nand the process is destroyed after it has completed its job. As opposed\nto Ruby where everything lives in one world and if you stop using the\nobject it will get GC&#39;d eventually impacting performance.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Immutability</h2>\n\n<p>Immutability got a bad rap when memory was expensive. Why would we write\napplications in such a way so as to waste memory by having variables\nwho&#39;s values couldn&#39;t be mutated? Memory is now super cheap, and this is\nnot much of a concern. With this in mind we can evaluate immutability\nwithin the context it was originally meant: to ensure state. When we\ntalk about parallel processing the state of a process becomes very\nimportant. If we are expecting <code>X</code> to always be a specific value but we\nare writing in a language where <code>X</code> can change this can lead to\nproblems.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Fault Tolerance</h2>\n\n<p>This one really impressed me when I started to dig into it. You may have\nheard that Erlang was invented for telephony. How often do you get a\nmessage from your phone company saying &quot;we&#39;re updating our systems so\nyou won&#39;t get a call for a while&quot;. This is the level of uptime that is\nachievable with Elixir. Hot code swapping is another very cool feature.\nThink <strong>real</strong> Zero Downtime Deploys.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Community</h2>\n\n<p>This one is more personal to me. I&#39;m attracted to technology that is not\ncentralized into one company. Go and Rust are very much just Google and\nMozilla technologies. Those languages will always be at the whim of\ntheir corporate masters, wheras a language like Elixir that is not tied\nto any one company feels like it has a more democratic process behind\nits development. Let many companies develop use-cases and improve the\nlanguage. (I realize that Erlang falls into this category, but Erlang is\npretty much set in stone at this point)</p>\n\n<p>The community around Elixir also feels very much like the Ruby community\ndid early on. I said the same thing about the Ember.js community. I\nguess I&#39;m just chasing that Ruby dragon, trying to catch that high\nagain.</p>\n\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve been exploring Elixir heavily over the past few months. The more I\ndig into the language the more I love it. We&#39;re going to bet pretty\nheavily on Elixir and if you are a Ruby developer looking for a change\nin pace I highly suggest you check it out.

You can use it to retrieve\nother global objects besides <code>require</code>, such as <code>global.process</code>.\nHowever, many of them are made available directly on the <code>window</code> object, so you can\nreference them without prefix, just as you would in Node:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>console.log(window.process === global.process) <span class=\"comment\">// =&gt; true</span>\nconsole.log(process.env.USER) <span class=\"comment\">// &quot;brzpegasus&quot;</span>\nconsole.log(process.platform) <span class=\"comment\">// &quot;darwin&quot;</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h2>Naming Conflicts</h2>\n\n<p>Modules written with ES2015 (<a href=\"https://esdiscuss.org/topic/javascript-2015#content-3\">previously, ES6</a>)\nsyntax in your Ember app get transpiled into\nAMD for today&#39;s browsers. This is problematic because AMD also specifies a\n<code>require</code> function for loading modules. In Ember CLI, this is implemented via\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ember-cli/loader.js\">ember-cli/loader.js</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By the time the app is done loading, any functionality that depends on\nthe native UI library or Node modules will break as the <code>require</code>\nfunction would have been redefined.</p>\n\n<p>You can get around this by saving a reference to Node&#39;s <code>require</code> before loading\nany script. Once all scripts are loaded and executed, redefine <code>require</code>\nto work with both module systems. This is necessary as certain operations\nwill not work with the alias:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"comment\">// Before loading any script</span>\nwindow.requireNode = require;\n\n<span class=\"comment\">// After all scripts are loaded</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">var</span> requireAMD = require;\n\nwindow.<span class=\"function\">require</span> = <span class=\"keyword\">function</span>() {\n  <span class=\"keyword\">try</span> {\n    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> requireAMD.apply(<span class=\"predefined-constant\">null</span>, <span class=\"local-variable\">arguments</span>);\n  } <span class=\"keyword\">catch</span> (error) {\n    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> requireNode.apply(<span class=\"predefined-constant\">null</span>, <span class=\"local-variable\">arguments</span>);\n  }\n};\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h2>An Addon For All Your NW.js Needs</h2>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve recently released an Ember CLI addon to help make this process\neasier.

We had this application as a single repository, where there\nwere two folders at the root, <code>frontend</code> and <code>backend</code>. This was somewhat easy\nto test on Travis-CI; it would check out the one repository, run the Rails\ntests, start the Rails server, then run the ember tests that hit the Rails\nserver. This ended up being a pain to deploy, as when you changed the Rails app,\nyou were going to redeploy the Ember app, and vice-versa.  It also presented an\nissue when deploying to Heroku, as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceFNLdswFxs&amp;t=4103\">we had to utilize <code>git subtree</code> to push\nthe backend</a>, which\ncontained the production assets.</p>\n\n<p>With the latest project I started, I&#39;m keeping the backend and the Ember app\nseparate.  Since the apps are separate, they can be deployed independant of\neach other. This made it a little bit harder to run integration tests against\nthe backend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Side note:</strong> while you can mock/stub your API in your Ember tests, it is\nimportant to run integration tests against your backend regularly. When you\nmock your API, it ends up giving you this false sense of security when it comes\nto your Ember app being compatible. Your models may line up perfectly with your\nmocks, but your mocks can fall out of date. To prevent this, at least when\nrunning on your continuous integration (CI) server, you should have your Ember\napp hit the backend server.</p>\n\n<p>To run end-to-end integration tests on Travis-CI, I added tasks to the\n<code>.travis.yml</code> file to clone the backend repository, install dependencies, and\nrun the server:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight yml \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n<strong>20</strong>\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n<strong>30</strong>\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"key\">language</span>: <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">node_js</span></span>\n<span class=\"key\">node_js</span>:\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">0.12</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n\n<span class=\"key\">sudo</span>: <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">false</span></span>\n<span class=\"key\">cache</span>:\n  <span class=\"key\">directories</span>:\n    - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">node_modules</span></span>\n    - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">backend</span></span>\n    - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">vendor/bundle</span></span>\n\n<span class=\"key\">before_install</span>:\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">npm config set spin false</span></span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">npm install -g npm@^2</span></span>\n  <span class=\"comment\"># Select the RVM version</span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">rvm use 2.2.1 --install --binary --fuzzy</span></span>\n  <span class=\"comment\"># Clone the repository if isn't cloned</span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">[ -d backend/.git ] || git clone git@github.com:&lt;backend-repo&gt; backend</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">cd backend</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n  <span class=\"comment\"># Reset the repo so we can have a conflict-less pull</span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">git reset --hard</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">git clean -f</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">git pull</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n  <span class=\"comment\"># Install dependencies</span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">bundle install --path=../vendor/bundle --jobs=3 --retry=3 --deployment</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n  <span class=\"comment\"># Run the server</span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">RAILS_ENV=test ./bin/rails s &amp;</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n  <span class=\"comment\"># Wait for the Rails app to start</span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">sleep 5</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">cd ..</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n\n<span class=\"key\">install</span>:\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">npm install -g bower</span></span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">npm install</span></span>\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">bower install</span></span>\n\n<span class=\"key\">script</span>:\n  - <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">npm test</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Note that I cached both the backend and bundle directories to speed up the time\nit takes to get the backend running.

The only other required step was to add an SSH private key to\nthe Travis settings, since you would have two separate deploy keys. That would\nprevent you from cloning the backend repository from the frontend test.  There\nshould be nothing holding you back from performing end to end tests when you\nhave separate repositories!</p>\n","summary":"How can you run full integration tests when using separate repos?","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ember","testing"],"date":"2015-03-25T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/03/24/rubyists-guide-to-ember-dependencies","title":"Rubyists Guide to Ember.js Dependencies","dockyarder":"michael-dupuis","body":"<p>One of the early hurdles a Ruby developer faces when working on an Ember.js application is dependency management. A popular mechanism for managing a Ruby application\u2019s dependencies is the <a href=\"http://bundler.io/gemfile.html\">Gemfile</a> provided by <a href=\"http://bundler.io/\">Bundler</a>. Including a library is as easy as declaring it in the Gemfile and running <code>bundle install</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"comment\"># Gemfile</span>\nsource <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">https://rubygems.org</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\ngem <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">rails</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">~&gt; 4.2.0</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>For better or worse, there is no dominant, single package manager in JavaScript. Ember applications, and more specifically, those running <a href=\"http://www.ember-cli.com/\">Ember-CLI</a>, rely on two package managers: <a href=\"http://bower.io/\">Bower</a> for client-side libraries and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npm</a> for server-side libraries.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, I&#39;ll provide a basic dependency management primer for\nthose moving from Ruby to JavaScript.</p>\n\n<h1>npm</h1>\n\n<p>Ember-CLI uses npm to manage internal dependencies. npm resembles RubyGems, in so far as it allows you to install and manage third-party libraries, which in this case, are Node.js programs.</p>\n\n<h2>package.json</h2>\n\n<p>Libraries for npm are referred to as \u201cpackages.\u201d Each package has a <code>package.json</code> file which lists the dependencies of the library itself. In this regard, the <code>package.json</code> is analogous to a RubyGem\u2019s <code>gemspec</code> file.</p>\n\n<h2>.npmrc</h2>\n\n<p>You can configure how node packages get installed via the\n<a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc\">.npmrc file</a>. You may have one\nglobally, per user (<code>~/.npmrc</code>), or per project.</p>\n\n<h2>Installing dependencies</h2>\n\n<p>To install an npm package, run <code>npm install [package-name]</code> from the\ncommand line.</p>\n\n<p>This will either install the library and it&#39;s dependencies\ninto your current working directory or in one of its parent directories. Here&#39;s how it works: if there is a <code>node_modules/</code> or <code>package.json</code> in any directory above the current working directory, packages will be installed into that directory. Otherwise, calling <code>npm install [package-name]</code> creates a <code>node_modules/</code> directory in your current working directory and installs the packages there.</p>\n\n<p>This is a slightly different mental model for Rubyists who are not used to installing gems on a per project basis; gems are generally installed into version-specific Ruby directories with the more popular version managers like <a href=\"https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv\">rbenv</a> or <a href=\"https://rvm.io/\">RVM</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s also possible to install packages globally using the <code>--global</code> flag when installing. This installs the package in your <code>usr/local/lib/</code> directory by default. These packages typically contain executable files and are used via the command line (such as Ember-CLI).</p>\n\n<p>Your dependencies will likely have dependencies. These get installed within a <code>node_modules/</code> directory in the given package. It&#39;s a little strange the first time you navigate into a <code>node_modules/package-name/</code> only to find another <code>node_modules/</code> directory, but that&#39;s what that is. You\u2019ll notice a <code>node_modules/</code> directory for dependencies of global packages as well if you look in the <code>usr/local/lib/</code> directory where global packages live.</p>\n\n<p>One last thing to note regarding npm installations: npm caches the\nlibraries you pull down to prevent you from having to download\nlibraries that are already on your system. You&#39;ll find that cache:\n<code>~/.npm/</code>.</p>\n\n<h1>Bower</h1>\n\n<p>While you&#39;ll use npm to manage your server-side Node.js dependencies, you\u2019ll use Bower for managing front-end assets, such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, image, and font files.</p>\n\n<h2>.bowerrc</h2>\n\n<p>Bower itself is an npm package. Its libraries are referred to as \u201ccomponents\u201d and the end user can configure their installations via a <code>.bowerrc</code> file. This file specifies where dependent components will be installed, the URL where the component will be registered (its registry), and the JSON file used to define the component (<code>bower.json</code> by default) among other things.</p>\n\n<h2>bower.json</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://bower.io/docs/creating-packages/#bowerjson\"><code>bower.json</code></a> file resembles the <a href=\"http://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/\">gemspec</a> file you find in Ruby gems. It contains the library metadata, such as the name, version, dependencies, and development dependencies for the library.</p>\n\n<p>As we mentioned, components can be searched for via registries. The registry matches the name of a component with the endpoint at which it\u2019s hosted. <a href=\"http://bower.io/search/\">Bower.io/search</a> closely resembles <a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems\">rubygems.org</a> in this way.</p>\n\n<h2>Installing dependencies</h2>\n\n<p>When you install a Bower component via <code>bower install [component_name]</code>, the repository will be cached locally to expedite any future installations of the component. In case you\u2019re curious, the bower cache location is: <code>~/.cache/bower/</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike npm, Bower components are installed &quot;flat&quot; as opposed to in a hierarchical manner; all of your project&#39;s components (and their dependencies) will be installed into <code>bower_components/</code> directory, by default. For example, if one of your components is dependent on the <code>underscore.js</code> library, both will sit side-by-side in the <code>bower_components/</code> directory (remember, with npm, dependencies of dependencies are continually nested in their parent&#39;s directory within a <code>node_modules/</code> directory).</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a quick wrap-up of the analogous files between Ruby and the JS\npackage managers we discussed:</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Ruby</th>\n<th>JS (npm, server-side)</th>\n<th>JS (Bower, client-side)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Term for external library</td>\n<td>&quot;Gem&quot;</td>\n<td>&quot;Package&quot;</td>\n<td>&quot;Component&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>End-user configuration file</td>\n<td><code>.gemrc</code></td>\n<td><code>.npmrc</code></td>\n<td><code>.bowerrc</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Per-library configuration file</td>\n<td><code>*.gemspec</code></td>\n<td><code>package.json</code></td>\n<td><code>bower.json</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cache directory</td>\n<td><code>~/.gem/</code></td>\n<td><code>~/.npm/</code></td>\n<td><code>~/.cache/bower/</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>As ES2015 (formerly known as &quot;ES6&quot;) becomes more prevalent and JavaScript code becomes more\nmodular and better for passing around, dependency management grows in\nimportance.

But experts have one significant blind spot - their extensive knowledge of the system makes them less likely to see the potential problems a novice would encounter. Anyone who is very familiar with a system, a discipline, or a product has put some distance between them and their beginning level challenges that cause them to develop an <a href=\"http://c4ed.lib.kmutt.ac.th/sites/default/files/HowLearningWorks-Ambrose.pdf\">expert blind spot</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am sure you are familiar with this situation: you\u2019re invited (or invite yourself) to an event at a university campus. You arrive a bit earlier than you needed, so you can orient yourself in the unfamiliar space. The map on your phone is only accurate to the nearest block, so you get a campus map and try to find room 41-B in the Humanities building named after someone important. You feel stupid.</p>\n\n<p>This is what campus maps often look like:\n<img src=\"http://imgur.com/Aulbb3t.jpg\" alt=\"An old map showing a campus as an island surrounded by unknown waters\"></p>\n\n<p>The reason most outsiders find campus maps confusing and difficult to use is the shift in the frame of reference. </p>\n\n<p>For someone who lives or works on campus, the frame of reference is relative to the borders and shape of the universe that is the university (or corporate, or hospital) campus. They might consider their office to be \u201cin the far North corner\u201d relative to the outline of the campus on a map. Or, they might think of themselves as \u201cright in the middle of the Art Department\u201d. The Art Department here is amorphous: it\u2019s something that may either span two city blocks, or half of a floor in a physical building.</p>\n\n<p>For an outsider, the frame of reference is still the surrounding landscape. They may not know precisely when they entered the school campus (there is no painted border on the ground) or that they are in its top left corner. The \u201cyou are here\u201d marker on the campus map helps, but it still takes a while to adjust to the landmarks differentiated by department, not by road or city block. To find a building, they are forced to adapt to a new system of coordinates. </p>\n\n<h2>Work with an outsider</h2>\n\n<p>I often see this situation reflected in the websites of large institutions. When someone very close to an institution thinks of how their web presence may be organized or used, they inevitably do so with the influence of all the expertise they have. They can\u2019t help it - they \u201clive\u201d inside the campus, and they are good at what they do.</p>\n\n<p>There are many examples of this kind of insider thinking: organizing content by internal structure (instead of user need), breaking up a university website into Athletics, Academics, and Arts (which one contains the event I want to attend?) or assuming that a typical user has even a basic understanding of specialized terminology and concepts.</p>\n\n<p>This is by no means a treaty against specialized knowledge and perspective. The insider knowledge of an industry expert makes a product good, their know-how makes it work. But the outside perspective of a novice-expert truly helps make a product findable and usable.</p>\n\n<p>To attract new customers or visitors, a product needs to make sense to someone unfamiliar with it in their own broader frame of reference. To ask the right questions, to establish user goals and needs, and to judge the effectiveness and clarity of a product, we need both the insider and the outsider perspective.</p>\n","summary":"A fresh perspective can help an expert find and address their blind spots.","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design","observations"],"date":"2015-03-23T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/03/22/tips-for-writing-ember-addons","title":"Tips for writing Ember Addons","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>After having published many Ember addons I have started to develop my\nown sense of &quot;Best Practices&quot; and I&#39;d like to share those with you:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Keep it minimal, don&#39;t include stylesheets</h2>\n\n<p>I see quite a few addons out there that include their own look &amp; feel by\nincluding sytlesheets. I actually think this is a bad idea. <em>Keep in\nmind, every line of code you put into your addon will end up in the\nfinal footprint of the apps consuming it</em>. This means if you are\nincluding stylesheets those will end up in <code>vendor.css</code>. The odds are\nthat whatever styles you decide look good, someone else might not.\nThey&#39;ll waste even more space by including their own overrides. This is\nwasteful.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, you should <em>keep it minimal</em>. See\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-admin\">ember-admin</a>. I intentionally\ndid not style the addon so it is left as minimal as possible. If you\nwant to show off a styled version of the addon, you can either include\nstyles in the dummy app&#39;s styles for the addon&#39;s test dummy. Allow\npeople to run the addon&#39;s server locally and view what could be. Or, you\ncan include an addon wrapper library that depends upon your addon. This\nwrapper can include default styles that consumers may choose not to\nalter. For example,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-admin-bootstrap\">ember-admin-bootstrap</a>\nstyles ember-admin with Twitter Bootstrap. If this is good enough for\nyou then you just install this library and it pulls in ember-admin but\ngives you some nice styling that you don&#39;t have to spend time doing.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Allow for overrides</h2>\n\n<p>I believe strongly in composable addons. A consumer should have the\nability to easily extend your addon to do whatever they want. This means\norganizing your code a certain way. To provide this you should put all\nof your business logic into <code>addon/</code> and then include wrapper classes in\n<code>app/</code> that just <code>import</code> then <code>export</code> the extended class. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"comment\">// addon/components/foo-bar.js</span>\n<span class=\"reserved\">import</span> Ember from <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">ember</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>;\n<span class=\"reserved\">export</span> <span class=\"keyword\">default</span> Ember.Component.extend({\n  <span class=\"comment\">// business logic</span>\n});\n\n<span class=\"comment\">// app/components/foo-bar.js</span>\n<span class=\"reserved\">import</span> FooBar from <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">my-addon/components/foo-bar</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>;\n<span class=\"reserved\">export</span> <span class=\"keyword\">default</span> FooBar;\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>These light wrapper classes <strong>should not</strong> include any business logic.\nAgain, they simply <code>import</code> then <code>export</code> the extended class. This gives\nconsumers the option of overriding this in their own\n<code>app/components/foo-bar.js</code> file to extend and add customization.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Turn off Prototype Extensions</h2>\n\n<p>Currently ember-cli will not generate an addon project with Prototype\nExtensions turn off. However, <a href=\"https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/3443\">I have requested this be the\ndefault</a>. Turning\noff Prototype Extensions will cause the following syntax to fail in\nyour addon&#39;s test suite:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"function\">foo</span>: <span class=\"keyword\">function</span>() {\n  <span class=\"comment\">// whatever</span>\n}.property(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">bar</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>)\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>There are several syntax shortcuts that Ember injects into the base\nTypes. Arrays have quite a bit. Turning off Prototype Extensions will\nforce you to write the above code as:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>foo: Ember.computed(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">bar</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"keyword\">function</span>() {\n  <span class=\"comment\">// whatever</span>\n})\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>And this will play nice with consumer applications that must run with\nthe Prototype Extensions turned off.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/10590\">It should be noted that Ember 1.10 has a bug where turning off Prototype\nExtensions causes Ember itself to\nfail</a>. This should be\nfixed in 1.11 (<strong>Update: This has been addressed in <a href=\"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/10697\">Ember</a>.</strong>).</p>\n\n<p>Avoiding Prototype Extensions can be difficult. I plan on writing a\nfuture blog post to outline certain strategies to duplicate the behavior\nthat you miss out on without Prototype Extensions.</p>\n\n<p>To turn off Prototype Extensions you&#39;ll need to install the <code>ember-disable-prototype-extensions</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>npm install --save-dev ember-disable-prototype-extensions\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>See\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-validations/pull/270\">ember-validations</a>\nfor an example.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Test your addon</h2>\n\n<p>This one should go without saying but I have seen <em>way</em> too many addons\nout there that are untested (the generated tests don&#39;t count). Please\nkeep in mind that there are people building products that might consume\nyour work. Untested code is just one more thing that could go wrong in\nsomeone&#39;s app. If unit testing the code is too difficult, at the very\nleast write integration tests against the dummy application to ensure\nthe happy paths.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Depend on other addons</h2>\n\n<p>You may not know this but addons can depend upon addons. Rather than\nrecreating behavior per-addon it would be best to extract out common\nbehavior to its own dependency. For example,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-data-route\">ember-data-route</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-cli-async-button\">ember-cli-async-button</a>\nare both being used in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-admin/blob/master/package.json#L21-L23\">ember-admin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To use an addon as a dependency it <em>must</em> be put into the <code>dependencies</code>\nobject in <code>package.json</code>, <strong>not</strong> <code>devDependencies</code>. You may need to\nadd this keyword to your <code>package.json</code> as it is not part of the\nauto-generated file.</p>\n\n<p>Ember&#39;s addon eco-system is getting better every day, and as a community\nwe are learning as we grow how best to build and maintain addons. I&#39;m\nhoping you find these tips helpful. Please feel free to share your own\nin the comments below. </p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ember","javascript"],"date":"2015-03-22T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/03/19/lean-project-management","title":"The Lean Project","dockyarder":"jon-lacks","body":"<p>I am a firm believer in Lean processes aimed to maximize value while minimizing waste. When it comes to running projects in a Lean way, this goes far beyond the role of the Project Manager (or Scrum-master) thus requiring the right recipe of team, process, communication, work environment and pride. Often I am asked what are the typical practices I apply to projects which fall in the mobile/desktop application development context- this is my attempt to answer the question.  <strong>Important disclaimer</strong> - this is not a prescription for how to run a project, nor does it guarantee success. The secret sauce is always the people NOT the process. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Raw Materials</strong></p>\n\n<p>If any of these seem unreasonable, you need to take a hard look at your team and work environment. Any concessions made here will reduce team effectiveness.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A team well-balanced in terms of seniority - Experience is contagious!</li>\n<li>Dedicated team members - not split across multiple projects</li>\n<li>Co-located team members</li>\n<li>Smaller teams (no more than 5-7) \u2014  Once you breach this team size communication complexity increases exponentially.<br></li>\n<li>Conduct retrospectives with full participation - Always seek to get better</li>\n<li>A knowledge management strategy ensures team members know where to store/post directional artifacts that other team members require to do their job (e.g. Wireframes, PSDs, Test Cases, Context Diagrams )</li>\n<li>Use of Information Radiators \u2014 Physical views into plans (e.g. Post-Its on a whiteboards) that may supplement a digital plan view</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>1) Breakdown the work</strong></p>\n\n<p>Decomposition of capabilities/features is a necessary and somewhat painful evil.  However, you do not need to go to a painful level of detail to create this artifact.  The importance is breadth not necessarily depth.  The depth only needs to go as far as necessary for the team to directionally understand where a feature needs to go. If a team member is able to provide some form of time estimate (best and worst case) for one of those lower level items, you&#39;re low level enough. If estimates are coming out to less than 1 day you have likely gone too far.  Get the full team involved, apply the 80/20 rule in terms of completeness and time-box the activity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2) Define a Path</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once you have step 1 in place, work with the team to derive a chronological execution of the work driven by perceived value and/or risk/complexity of a given feature.  Front loading your risk/complexity (as long as it is somewhat high value) is a very acceptable and smart approach because impact of course correction early on is much less invasive than the alternative.   Ensure a basic architecture for the overall solution is derived and communicated. This ensures that the team has a solid foundation to build upon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3) Respect the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle\">Pyramid of constraint</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Scope, Time and Cost \u2014  Fundamental variables applicable to any project context.  Visibility and active monitoring of these variables is essential to ensure project success.  First and foremost, ensure that a baseline is established for each of these variables before a team even start the project. Understand how your stakeholders rate the relative importance of each of these variables and uphold the &quot;Rule&quot; that trade-offs are the only way these baselines can/will adjust.   Deferring this activity to after a project gets going can result in scope creep and cost/time over runs.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>4) Hold up the mirror</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a PM, it\u2019s your responsibility to hold up a mirror in front of your team that shows the good, the bad, and the ugly.  This allows the team to maintain appreciation for the big picture while they do their best to work through the small one.   I am huge advocate of a plan view that I have written about in the past (<a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/07/29/project-carpe-diem.html\">High and Mid-Level Plans</a>) \u2014 which shows time, features, tasks, distribution of work across team capability areas (Design, Backend, UXD, etc.), progress made, unplanned work and deferred work that will come in later releases.  If you have this and revisit it often, consider your team informed and that those Triangle of Constraint variables are being monitored (for the most part.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>5) Create an environment of ownership and accountability</strong></p>\n\n<p>Everyone is a player. PM\u2019s should be servant leaders, therefore any plan created needs to be the team&#39;s plan not the PM\u2019s (or Sr. Mgmt.)  This way the team has accountability and ownership rights over whatever happens to the plan.  If something is not going as planned the team can understand the implications of this and course correct and work to reveal why something may not be working out.  Constant readjustment and calibration is required to keep things moving along. The project manager helps ensure these conversations happen.</p>\n\n<p>No team member can slip into the shadows. To be successful every contributor needs to have a voice.  A PM needs to put their \u201cFacilitation\u201d hats on and ensure they proactively encourage all to participate and chime in on team affairs. That\u2019s the beauty of teams. They succeed together, not as individuals. </p>\n\n<p><strong>6) Demonstrate Progress</strong></p>\n\n<p>Demos encourage quality, because no one wants to demo something that works and looks subpar. Stakeholders  can rest assured they did not buy snake oil and value is being delivered in some regular interval.  Demonstrations affirm you&#39;re heading in the right direction.  Last but not least, demos allow the team to celebrate success in short bursts - It feels great to get something done especially when the road ahead is a long one!</p>\n\n<p>Give it a go and let me know if this works for your team.</p>\n","summary":"The right recipe of team, process, communication, work environment and pride","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["project-management","lean","agile"],"date":"2015-03-19T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/03/18/the-doldrums-of-consulting","title":"The Doldrums of Consulting","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/X6DGygm.jpg\" alt=\"http://i.imgur.com/X6DGygm.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p><em>The Doldrums</em> is a sailing term.

How would I watch my Sixers, Eagles, and Phillies games if I left the Philly area?</p>\n\n<p>Then in a week and a half frenzy I was moving up to Boston after it had just snowed another two feet in Boston. A day after that I had moved in to my new apartment and it was my first day at DockYard as a Junior UX Developer!</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward a week and I had met 16 new DockYard co-workers (who, yes, are crazy smart) and was introduced to a new coding/project management environment. I was then challeneged to learn how to  structure my SCSS with the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/styleguides/blob/master/uxd/class-naming-conventions.md\">BEM</a>\nclass naming conventions and rules for Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/styleguides/blob/master/uxd/beginning-a-project.md\">SMACSS</a>), all of this  was a tidal wave of new information and personally a different way of thinking.</p>\n\n<h2>It\u2019s Not All About You</h2>\n\n<p>I would love to say that the sole reason that I\u2019ve been able to handle all the new information is that I am purely that awesome.

If you need help and you\u2019re not approaching other team members with questions, you might find yourself out of place.</p>\n\n<p>This type of atmosphere is exactly what you need for soaking in all the information you receive at a new job. You will always have questions and uncertainties in a new environment like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Am I meeting their expectations</li>\n<li>Am I messing this up</li>\n<li>Will I look stupid if I ask this question</li>\n<li>What will they think if...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is inevitable to have these questions when you are in a new work place and you should have them, don&#39;t be afraid to solve those concerns by asking productive questions! The new company you just joined would rather be asked a stupid question then see you running in circles not willing to interact with the team.</p>\n\n<p>I have asked many questions in my first month here and not once has someone:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Said no</li>\n<li>Told me there was no point to my question</li>\n<li>Looked down on me for not knowing something</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That is a testament to DockYard but also should be how any team should be run, especially web development teams.</p>\n\n<h2>Success Is Ultimately Decided By You</h2>\n\n<p>Now it\u2019s not all up to the team you are joining to make you successful, you have to be willing to do the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Put time into reading about things you did not understand</li>\n<li>Research tools/techniques that you see yourself using in the future</li>\n<li>Be open minded with new development techniques and a new project management process</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are successful with goals/projects your boss gives you, then you are meeting your employers standards.

Today, I\u2019d like to focus on one rule about asking questions to get reliable results.</p>\n\n<h2>Ask open-ended questions.</h2>\n\n<p>Otherwise, the responses you get will be either biased or useless. </p>\n\n<h2>Let&#39;s look at some interview questions (from worst to best)</h2>\n\n<p>They appear in order: from least useful to most useful in getting you good responses. For context, imagine you\u2019re doing some user research and you&#39;re in the middle of a project to design some widgets.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>\u201cYou like this widget in green, right? We picked green because it\u2019s calming.\u201d</strong>\nThis question is so bad it&#39;s grotesque, but it may still happen to novice interviewers. Not only does the question suggest a specific answer (you like it!), but it also gives reasons why that answer might be the right one (green is calming!) The interviewee is not likely to share a genuine opinion with this much pressure to say \u201cyes, I love it in green!\u201d.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>\u201cHow do you feel about this widget? Do you like its color?\u201d</strong> Slightly better, but still of limited use. By suggesting a response and allowing the user to narrow it down to a binary yes/no, we\u2019re getting a very limited amount of information back. In addition, likes and dislikes move the conversation into a potentially awkward area. Some people may not be comfortable telling you they don\u2019t like something you made.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>\u201cHow do you feel about this widget? What do you think it does?\u201d</strong> Now, this is better. We are opening up to qualitative responses with lots of detail. By not suggesting options for what an answer might be, we are more likely to get unexpected, valuable results.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>\u201cTalk me through what you see here.\u201d</strong> A super open-ended question, useful in the beginning of an interview. Do they even see the widget?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>\u201cHow would you normally approach (widget-related task)?\u201d</strong> This seems to be the best opening question for a user interview. While not appropriate for all circumstances, it is great at opening up areas you may not have considered to be in the scope of the project. This question can help reframe the problem you are working to solve.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>\u201cHow did you last (widget-related task)?\u201d</strong> Past behavior is a more reliable indicator than a behavior people might describe as their normal. So, this re-phrasing can encourage more honest answers. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may notice that it takes more  time to ask open-ended questions. You may trigger your interviewee to share a lot of extra information, not just a concise answer to the question you asked. You may have to follow up with more questions to get to the \u201cwhy\u201d behind a certain behavior. But with the increased effort comes a better result. The responses are real. They are not influenced by your opinion about the thing you\u2019re asking, because you\u2019ve kept that opinion outside the questions. These responses present a more nuanced picture of your users\u2019 needs and environment.</p>\n\n<p>I condensed this principle from conference talks, books and workshops I attended over the past few years. Two sources in particular: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/michelleyaiser\">Michelle Yaiser&#39;s</a> talk on user research at <a href=\"http://uxeast.org/\">UX Camp</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://shop.npr.org/sound-reporting\">Sound reporting : the NPR guide to audio journalism and production</a>. This book is outside of the usual UX Design reading list, but it&#39;s useful for interviewing skills. It shows how much  effort and consideration it takes a journalist to gather information in a neutral, ethical way.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It&#39;s almost always a better investment of your time to conduct a few in-depth, \u201cdifficult\u201d and neutral interviews, than to rush many interviewees through surface-level questions. This is especially true at the beginning of a project, when more design options are open. Your effort to keep the process unbiased will yield quality results, and quality wins.</p>\n","summary":"The only way to get real answers in user interviews for UX design","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design","observations","quality","workflow"],"date":"2015-03-11T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/03/09/dockyard-is-now-accepting-staff-augmentation-ember-js-contracts","title":"DockYard is now accepting staff augmentation Ember.js contracts","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>Over the past three years DockYard has primarily taken on &quot;greenfield&quot;\nprojects, where we are responsible for building applications from\nscratch through design, development, and launch.

This is convenient as a jumping off point for aspiring programmers, who can simply open up Chrome\u2019s Web Inspector and start alerting \u201cHello, World!\u201d, but it\u2019s a concept that isn\u2019t easy to unpack. Soon enough, the developer will likely find herself in contact with JavaScript outside of the browser \u2013 Node.js being the most prominent example of this. At this point, the notion of JavaScript being a language for the browser is no longer helpful; it obfuscates what is happening when a developer executes a line of code.</p>\n\n<p>This post is a high level primer on what is happening \u201cunder the hood\u201d with our code. It will lend some insight into what terminology like \u201ctokenizing,\u201d \u201cinterpreting,\u201d \u201ccompiling,\u201d and a host of other terms mean. You&#39;ll gain a better sense of what the concept of a virtual machine encapsulates. And hopefully you&#39;ll leave with a better understanding of what your script is doing before it hits your computer&#39;s processor.</p>\n\n<p>I feel this article will be well-suited for Rubyists who find themselves increasingly working in the realm of JavaScript, as I\u2019ll be comparing how code executes between the two languages.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than explaining how a line of Ruby or JavaScript code gets processed and run, I\u2019d like to work our way backwards, beginning with machine code. When you write a line of Ruby, it doesn\u2019t simply go to the processor when you run the script. It goes through a number of translations before being turned into machine code that the processor can execute. We\u2019ll look at how Ruby gets processed and then touch on how JavaScript differs.</p>\n\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Sa1qURz.png\" alt=\"Ruby execution diagram\"></p>\n\n<h2>Machine code</h2>\n\n<p>Machine code is binary that is executed directly by your computer\u2019s CPU. The bit patterns correspond directly to the architecture design of the processor.</p>\n\n<p>Before a statement in a scripted language becomes machine code, it gets compiled into machine code by a compiler.</p>\n\n<h2>Virtual Machine</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html\">LLVM</a> compiles code on most\nUnix-based machines. It generates the machine code for the processor\nduring compilation, which is just the process of translating one language to another.</p>\n\n<p>The virtual machine executes your code. It&#39;s written in C and is known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YARV\">YARV</a> interpreter. It is at the heart of a scripting languages &quot;implementation,&quot; as it executes the source code via whatever language the scripting language is built upon (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)\">C</a> in the case of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_MRI\">Ruby MRI</a>). </p>\n\n<p>YARV doesn\u2019t receive the Ruby statement as you typed it. It goes through an abstraction of your code known as an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree\">Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)</a>, which get compiled to YARV byte code and run.</p>\n\n<p>This &quot;tree&quot; is made up of nodes assembled by something called the parser. </p>\n\n<h2>Parser</h2>\n\n<p>You can think of a node on the Abstract Syntax Tree as an atomic representation of a Ruby grammar rule. The reason that Ruby knows to print \u201cHello, World\u201d when it sees <code>print &#39;Hello, World&#39;</code> is because the parser knows that <code>print</code> is a method and the string <code>&#39;Hello, World&#39;</code> is its argument. These syntax rules are located inside of a language\u2019s grammar rule file.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the parser creates the Abstract Syntax Tree that the virtual machine compiles and interprets.</p>\n\n<h2>Tokenizer/Lexer</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering how Ruby knows that <code>print</code> is a separate element in the language from <code>&#39;Hello, World&#39;</code>, then you\u2019re understanding the function of the Lexer or Tokenizer. The Tokenizer scans your line of Ruby code, character-by-character and determines where the &quot;words&quot; of the language begin and end. The Tokenizer can tell the difference between a space separating words and a space separating a method name from its arguments.</p>\n\n<p>And that\u2019s the 10,000 foot lifecycle of a Ruby statement, as it goes from Tokenization to becoming machine code. If you\u2019re looking for the microscopic explanation, I\u2019d recommend <a href=\"http://www.nostarch.com/rum\">Ruby Under a Microscope</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>JavaScript</h1>\n\n<h2>Client-side</h2>\n\n<p>Most browsers implement <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation\">Just-In-Time (JIT) compiling</a>. This means that the JavaScript code you write is compiled right before it gets executed by the virtual machine; though, in JavaScript, the interpreter is not referred to as a virtual machine, but as a JavaScript engine.</p>\n\n<p>V8 is the engine that interprets and executes JavaScript in the Chrome browser, Nitro is the engine for Safari, SpiderMonkey for Firefox, and Chakra on Internet Explorer. The efficiency with which a browser interprets JavaScript accounts for a substantial portion of its performance these days, especially as JavaScript-heavy, Single Page Applications become increasingly important.</p>\n\n<h2>Server-side</h2>\n\n<p>Node.js is the predominant framework for running JavaScript server-side. It is built on top of Google\u2019s V8 engine, which is a little confusing if you\u2019ve just read that V8 interprets JavaScript in the browser. In general terms, the JavaScript interpreter is extracted from Chrome, compiled on the server, and utilized by Node.js, allowing you to execute JavaScript outside of the browser.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>Upon researching how a line of Ruby or JavaScript gets executed, you&#39;ll quickly find that you can go down a rabbit hole. There are so many different implementations of Ruby, so many advancements in how code gets processed, and so much ambiguity in the terminology we use, that it can be quite challenging to form a mental model of what&#39;s going on under the hood. That being said, a little patience goes a long way, and if you&#39;re looking to dive into any one of the topics described above, I think you&#39;ll be surprised at how readable much of the technical documentation is out there.</p>\n","summary":"A high-level look at how your Ruby and JavaScript code gets executed.","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ruby","javascript"],"date":"2015-02-24T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/02/12/automating-reefpoints","title":"Automating Reefpoints","dockyarder":"dan-mcclain","body":"<p>We have a healthy mix of developers and designers, plus a project manager and\noffice manager.

What we gather will help us decide what to build, and how. This makes our ability to source qualitative information very important to the success of a product.</p>\n\n<p>A user interview is, at its essence, a closely managed conversation. It is my responsibility, as the designer, to manage it. The level of control required of the UX designer in this situation is unfamiliar, and can be stressful in the beginning. I think the reason for this initial discomfort is that we have little context for this managed type of conversation in our everyday life. We\u2019re used to conversations in which both parties share control over the direction and tone. Owning the conversation completely can feel rough and undemocratic. It takes skill and experience to do it while making the other party feel at ease.</p>\n\n<p>I want to share what I learned while conducting interviews and user tests at DockYard. I hope this will take some of the edge off the initial difficulty for others also learning this skill, and make it a more pleasant and productive time for all.</p>\n\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n\n<h3>1. Prepare well</h3>\n\n<p>There is a lot of prep work involved, before the conversations can even start. Taking the time to do these steps properly allows me to get the most out of the time I spend with the interviewee.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Schedule the interviews. You may need to find suitable users yourself. Or, the client may help by putting you in touch with some preselected users to interview. Try not to schedule interviews back-to-back in case one takes a bit longer than expected.</li>\n<li>Arrange for the legal details. This could include notifying the interviewee of privacy arrangements, having them sign an NDA, or otherwise vetting the situation. Basically, you want to protect yourself, the person you\u2019re interviewing, and the client by specifying how information is going to be used.</li>\n<li>Draft a sequence of questions that cover your desired information.</li>\n<li>Edit until questions sound polished and neutral (more on this to follow, in a separate post)</li>\n<li>Prepare a notebook, pen and a laptop.</li>\n<li>Print the questions so I can write notes in context and check off completed ones.</li>\n<li>Prepare backups and extra copies of any materials I\u2019m planning to use.</li>\n<li>Grab water and a snack! You don\u2019t want to take focus away from the interview by being too thirsty or hungry.</li>\n<li>If needed, also grab a timer and a sound recorder (your needs may vary)</li>\n<li>Triple-check the list of interviewees and their basic information. For example, phone interviews can happen over different time zones. It\u2019s nice to verify you&#39;re not calling the person who kindly offered up their time at 6am.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. Establish context</h3>\n\n<p>Your interviewee should theoretically know who you are and what you\u2019re talking about. After all, they agreed to the interview. However, it is always a good idea to confirm your assumptions. A brief introduction won\u2019t hurt. For example, you could start with <em>\u201cHi ____, thank you for taking time to do this! My name is ____, and my company was hired by ____ to improve their product. How familiar are you with the product?\u201d</em></p>\n\n<h3>3. Direct the conversation</h3>\n\n<p>For a UX designer starting out, it may seem rude to redirect the conversation. Especially so if your interviewee is describing, with passion and detail, a subject they are an expert in. But don&#39;t be afraid to redirect the conversation. You need to get to the specific questions you want answered (but of course be nice about it!). For example, to get back on track, you might say <em>\u201cGreat - this extra information is very helpful, but I\u2019d like to get back to the original reason you started using ____?\u201d</em>  This acknowledges the value of their insight, then nudges them to answer your original question.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Go with the flow</h3>\n\n<p>At the start of the interview, there is a prepared, logical sequence of questions to ask. But in a conversation, one thing may lead naturally to another. If it makes sense to ask things out of order, it\u2019s totally acceptable to do so. This is where a printed list of questions helps. Check them off as you go to make sure none remain unanswered.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Use teamwork</h3>\n\n<p>It is definitely easier to have a team of two handling the interview. This way, one person asks questions while the other focuses on capturing notes. Some notes may be of things like body language, expression, and movement - all important indicators of how a user may feel about the questions in addition to what they actually say. An experienced interviewer could probably handle both tasks with grace. As a beginner, it&#39;s almost impossible. Try to do both at once, and you&#39;ll either get awkward pauses as you write notes, or you&#39;ll fail to record some of the valuable details.</p>\n\n<h3>6. Don\u2019t be afraid to clarify</h3>\n\n<p>Some interviews happen over the phone. The challenge here is that we lose most of the added information of body language and facial expression. This could be remedied with extra questions. For example, if I think the interviewee is referring to their laptop to answer something, I would literally ask that: <em>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re looking at the laptop screen for reference - is that correct?\u201d</em>  It is also important to be  attentive to the tone of voice so you can hear emotion, like hesitation.</p>\n\n<p>Another possible challenge in phone interviews is sound quality. Users may be on a shaky cell phone connection, or calling us via Skype. This can make their (and potentially your own) voice difficult to understand. It is tempting to dismiss the poor quality of sound and just omit details you can\u2019t quite hear. Make sure to always ask the interviewee to repeat or speak louder if you do not understand what\u2019s being said.</p>\n\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Conducting interviews caused me to cringe quite a few times. Am I doing it right? What does the interviewee think of me? Do I sound professional? Looking back, I can see how I and my colleagues got over our fears, and made significant improvements with just a few rounds of practice.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, both you and the interviewee are there because you want to improve some aspect of people\u2019s lives through your work and their experience. You\u2019re on the same side, and you share this interest in the thing you\u2019re discussing. Make the most of this interviewing situation, and you will see improved results each time.</p>\n","summary":"Learning to conduct user tests and interviews","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ux-design","research","discovery"],"date":"2015-02-11T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/02/06/ember-qunit-0-2","title":"Ember QUnit 0.2.x","dockyarder":"robert-jackson","body":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-qunit\">Ember QUnit</a> 0.2.x has been released. It brings a whole bunch of bug fixes and some much needed cleanup, but there are a couple breaking changes also.</p>\n\n<h3>History of the changes</h3>\n\n<p>Ember QUnit started as a self contained library to make unit testing of Ember applications significantly easier. Ember QUnit proved that unit testing an Ember application could be very simple, and users of other testing frameworks wanted to join in the unit testing fun.  Unfortunately, the early code was fairly coupled to <a href=\"http://qunitjs.com\">QUnit</a> (the testing framework being used) so reusing the Ember unit testing helpers separate from QUnit was not possible.</p>\n\n<p>Ember QUnit 0.2.x is a complete organizational refactor to remove the Ember unit testing helpers (into the appropriately named <a href=\"https://github.com/switchfly/ember-test-helpers\">ember-test-helpers</a>) and keep the QUnit specific parts in Ember QUnit. The majority of this refactoring effort was done by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dgeb\">Dan Gebhardt</a> and sponsored by the good folks at <a href=\"http://www.switchfly.com\">SwitchFly</a> (you can read their write-up of the work <a href=\"http://blog.switchfly.com/2014/11/Refactoring-Ember-Testing-for-Mocha\">here</a>). Out of this effort we have been able to create <a href=\"https://github.com/switchfly/ember-mocha\">Ember Mocha</a> which now has feature parity with Ember QUnit and is a truly first class Ember unit testing solution. Due to the usage of a general purpose underlying ember-test-helpers library, it should now be possible to create a nice wrapper around nearly any JS testing framework.</p>\n\n<h3>Notable Changes</h3>\n\n<h4>setup and teardown Deprecation</h4>\n\n<p><code>setup</code> and <code>teardown</code> are deprecated in favor of <code>beforeEach</code> / <code>afterEach</code>.

it allows us to quickly traverse through the current file\nopen or previously visited files.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s briefly cover some of the most familiar ones.</p>\n\n<h2>File Jumps</h2>\n\n<p><em>File jumps</em> will navigate you to a location within the current file, regardless if that\nlocation is seen or not seen within the window.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz-UvQYAmbg\" target=\"_blank\">Ain&#39;t no Mountain high enough, ain&#39;t no valley low enough...</a></h3>\n\n<p><strong>gg</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Will take you to the <em>top</em> of the file.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>G</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Will take you to the <em>bottom</em> of the file.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Sentences and Paragraphs</h3>\n\n<p><strong>(</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Move a <em>sentence backwards</em>, can take a prefix argument.\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>5(</strong> - Navigates you 5 sentences backwards.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>)</strong></p>\n\n<p>e Move a <em>sentence forward</em>, can take a prefix argument.\n  * <strong>10)</strong> - Navigates you 10 sentences forwards.</p>\n\n<p><strong>{</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Move a <em>paragraph backward</em>, can take a prefix argument.\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>5{</strong> - Navigates you 5 paragraphs backwards.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>}</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Move a <em>paragraph forward</em>, can take a prefix argument.\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>5}</strong> - Navigates you 5 paragraphs forwards.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDNzQ3CXspU\" target=\"_blank\">Search and Destroy</a></h3>\n\n<p><strong>/</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Allows you to search <em>forwards</em> for a desired pattern within the file.\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>/fishsticks</strong> - Searches for all occurences of <code>fishsticks</code> ahead of your current cursor.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Allows you to search <em>backwards</em> for a desired pattern within the file.\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>?catdog</strong> - Searches for all occurences of <code>catdog</code> behind your current cursor.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>n</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Repeats the last <strong>/</strong> or <strong>?</strong> search.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>N</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Repeats the last <strong>/</strong> or <strong>?</strong> search in the <em>opposite</em> direction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Window Jumps</h2>\n\n<p><em>Window</em> jumps allow you to move within the current scope of the window or viewport.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JECF2EB3LXU\" target=\"_blank\">High, Middle, and Low</a></h3>\n\n<p><strong>H</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jumps your cursor to the <strong>highest</strong> line of the window.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>M</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jumps your cursor to the <strong>middle</strong> line of the window.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>L</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jumps your cursor to the <strong>lowest</strong> line of the window.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>System Wide Jumps</h2>\n\n<p><em>System</em> jumps are special;

We can view all the jumps through Vim&#39;s\ncommand-line mode. There are three ways to open up the jump list.</p>\n\n<p><strong>:jumps</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>:jump</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>:ju</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Opens up the jump list</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mFc1cHz.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Above is an example of a jump list. There are four columns: <em>jump</em>, <em>line</em>, <em>col</em> and <em>file/text</em>.\nThe numbers underneath the <em>jump</em> column are used to prefix our jump command, <strong>CTRL-O</strong> and <strong>CTRL-I</strong>.\nWe are also given the position of our cursor from the  <em>line</em> and <em>col</em>umn columns. Lastly, the\n<em>file/text</em> column, gives us either the file path or, if the jump is located in our currently opened file,\nthe line of text.</p>\n\n<p>Using our example jump list, if we want to jump to the <code>4</code>th jump, located within <code>~/dir2/file.md</code>, we&#39;d\nprefix our previous jump command with the number <strong>4</strong>, i.e. <strong>4CTRL-O</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Next if we want to get back to our previous position, the line\n<code>This is another sentence!</code> we can cycle back to it with a couple of <strong>CTRL-I</strong>s. Cool!</p>\n\n<p>I find that <em>jump</em> motion complements <em>mark</em> motion really well. By setting multiple marks in the current file,\nand flying to different files with jumps, my workflow has greatly improved.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you give <em>jump</em> motion a try!</p>\n","summary":"Kris Kross' favorite Vim feature","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["vim","workflow"],"date":"2015-02-04T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/02/02/debugging-a-broccoli-tree","title":"Debugging a Broccoli Tree","dockyarder":"robert-jackson","body":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli\">Broccoli</a> is a great tool for building up assets gradually through a list of changing steps.

Within this context React&#39;s templates\ncan call native components (and views) as if you were referring to normal\nHTML elements. Furthermore a JavaScript layer has been introduced to the\nnative layer that runs the React applications, this means that you can\ndebug your React Native applications in Chrome Web Tools while it runs\non an iOS device.</p>\n\n<p>This is <em>amazing</em> technology and I don&#39;t think anyone was expecting\nthis. As an Ember developer I&#39;m jealous. After some reflection I\nrealized I was also incredibly disappointed in Facebook for heading in\nthis direction.</p>\n\n<h3>We are (supposed to be) all in this together</h3>\n\n<p>The web development Holy Grail right now is to compete directly with (perhaps\nsomeday replace) native mobile applications. With React Native the web\nhas lost a huge partner in Facebook for helping make this a reality.\nWhat incentive does Facebook have for pushing forward mobile web now\nthat they can just produce native applications with web technology? What\nincentive do the existing React developers (and the large number of\ndevelopers that will move to React in the near future) have for building\nand proving out mobile web use-cases with React Native? <strong>None</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>We are getting close</h3>\n\n<p>This year saw significant improvements in mobile web. We are so close.\nCheck out this video from Google showing off the potential of mobile\nweb:</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0xRTEf-ytE\" frameborder=\"0\"\nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>No longer is mobile web a matter of <em>if</em> but a matter of <em>when</em>.\nHowever, with Facebook effectively taking themselves out of the\nconversation we&#39;ve lost one of the best use-cases and the largest voices\nwith one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>Mobile web is a point of friction currently, and that friction existing\nis good because it will drive people and companies to pursue solutions\nto the problem. React Native is a work-around for mobile web. Some will\nthink of it as a &quot;best of both worlds&quot; and perhaps they are correct. But\nthe problem of mobile web will continue to exist.</p>\n\n<h3>Business needs trump ideological ones</h3>\n\n<p>Of course Facebook should do what is in its own best interest. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/\">In 2012\nMark Zuckerberg said that Facebook bet too heavily on\nHTML5</a>.\nHe was correct then and he is correct now: mobile web feels like shit\nwhen compared to native. The User Experience is the primary concern for\nany product company. This, however, should not stop us from persuing\nmobile web and pushing the technology forward.

That experience can only be as good as the tools we have to shape and elevate that participation. At DockYard, we design and develop single page web apps using Ember as our client-side framework, because it allows for greater clarity of interaction, while keeping the technology transparent.</p>\n\n<p>A single page web app is a webpage that can update contents within the page without refreshing the entire browser window. Because the server doesn&#39;t dictate the display, the &quot;client,&quot; or browser, determines how to represent it. Only the data associated with the selection is changed to reflect the action. </p>\n\n<p>You can imagine how beneficial that real time feedback is on the user side of the experience. Whether aware of it or not, this creates a more immersive experience, and enables the user to better grasp the information by directing attention to content. There is more opportunity to nest information which alleviates information overload, and animation simplifies complexity while still engaging the user. </p>\n\n<p>To do this well, good information architecture and content organization are imperative. Functionality and interaction must be part of the architecture, but not interrupt the flow and navigation. The visual design and communication must be clear and directive. The design supports self directed navigation and the process is not disrupted by the reload of a page. Creating this kind of real time response in the browser is the result of better, faster performance, bringing us closer to a native feel from the web.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/118249906\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learnivore.com/\">Learnivore</a> is a website that connects teachers and students searching for instruction across many disciplines. The search page is one of the largest hubs in the Learnivore experience. This <a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2015/01/07/complex-search-pages-feel-better-in-ember.html\">&quot;complex search&quot;</a> filters by type of instruction, location, rate, price, qualifications, and more. The results change dynamically, reflecting the filter selection, as demonstrated in the video above.</p>\n\n<p>Good design empowers the user to make the choices they need to accomplish their goals. It promotes communication and supports informed decision making through real time response. The single page web app model and the technologies to create and innovate with it are at the forefront of mobile and web design and development. It is a technology that not only provides opportunities for creativity and innovation for designers and developers alike, it constructs a more informative and cooperative experience for our users.</p>\n","summary":"The UX benefits of Single Page Web Apps","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design","interaction","user-experience","native-web"],"date":"2015-01-30T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/01/28/estimation-buyers-guide","title":"Estimation Buyers Guide","dockyarder":"jon-lacks","body":"<p>As a Project Manager, I have seen estimates in all forms - points, days, months, hours, mario coins, etc. Many say estimates in Software development are garbage and significant margin of error should be the expected norm. I believe this perspective to be true if estimation is conducted in a vacuum vs. as a means to have a conversation with prospective clients about what it is going to take to achieve their vision.</p>\n\n<p>While estimation provides financial insight into a project, it also provides the project team with a point of reference when it comes to establishing schedules and conducting impact analysis when something needs to change (which is inevitable). As a project manager, a solid process by which we establish an estimate allows me to best serve the client and team.</p>\n\n<p>I would question any firm who claims to offer a high confidence estimate to a prospective client without spending time mapping out the direction an application/product may take on paper. I am not talking about writing a 50 page requirements document (which I once did on a project 10 years before I knew any better).  I am talking about getting the \u201csupporting&quot; cast the context they need to provide an informed perspective on the complexity associated with building the application.  This complexity spans design, engineering, quality and any other overhead associated with a project. </p>\n\n<p>Let me paint this picture for you. Client X wants to build out a new application. The team to build said application provides client X with an estimate based off of a couple pre-sales meetings. Cost is negotiated until everyone around the table is happy with the economics and then the project is handed over to the project team and they are told to build \u201cthis\u201d application in \u201cthis\u201d amount of time. Client X is doomed regardless of whether or not that application is handed over in the agreed amount of time. Here\u2019s why:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The team has no context - Therefore, they are going to spend the first weeks of development getting up to speed as opposed to delivering working features putting the schedule behind right out of the gate</li>\n<li>The team does not &quot;own&quot; the estimate -  Someone else provided it on their behalf (who wants to be responsible for something they don\u2019t own?)</li>\n<li>Unexpected risks and complexity will (not \u201cmay\u201d) put schedule at risk</li>\n<li>Quality will (not \u201cmay&quot;) suffer because the team will attempt to meet the date commitment at the expense of quality</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To avoid this at DockYard, we use a tool called Discovery. This is an intensive time-boxed exploration of a client\u2019s business objectives, market and user needs, as well as technological possibilities. These inputs translate into wireframes and those wireframes translate into an estimable breakdown of deliverables that provides a platform to discuss scope, schedule and cost with our client. Our Discovery phase is cross-functional where we have designers and developers working hand in hand to understand the direction a client wants to go. We iterate on design concepts, we discuss technical direction and potential complexities, we map out scope in a way that allows clients to make decisions which may adjust cost and schedule up or down.

On days like these, when I do not travel, I often go to the local library.</p>\n\n<p>Today gave me the perfect opportunity to see how easy it would be to find a specific bit of information (<em>is the library open today?</em>) on a library website.</p>\n\n<p>Like many government and community organizations, libraries are easy targets for ridicule when it comes to web design. Look at the outdated styles their site uses! How crowded it is! The HTML tables used for layout! The multi-colored announcements \u201cdesigned\u201d in Word!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>What I am looking for today is something else: I want to judge the achievability of a specific task regardless of the presentation. Presentation (layout, hierarchy, and just plain good design) affects a user\u2019s ability to achieve her goals, no doubt. I just want to start with the goals, and a specific measurement, rather than starting with the common pitfall of visual designers like myself: noticing the surface details that seem broken rather than the process behind them.</p>\n\n<p>So, here\u2019s my experiment:</p>\n\n<h2>Find out if the library is open today.</h2>\n\n<p><em>With a few considerations.</em></p>\n\n<p>It may be <strong>self evident</strong> that a library is closed on a government holiday. It was not to me. I assume that most casual users have a vague suspicion that it may be closed, and would seek confirmation via the website.</p>\n\n<p>I narrowed my search to just the homepage for this exercise, expecting to find the equivalent of a physical \u201cSorry, closed today!\u201d door sign. And while many libraries provided the same information on Twitter or Facebook, it would be prohibitive to compare all these resources for this quick study.</p>\n\n<p>I saw most of these homepages for the first time today. A regular user of the local library may notice things differently than a new user, so for example the \u201cCLOSED\u201d text announcement that replaces a daily schedule of events, might stand out more for them.</p>\n\n<p>I looked for three things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> was the holiday at all on the homepage, \u00a0</li>\n<li>was it clear, and\u00a0</li>\n<li>was it obvious?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I got about halfway down the alphabetized list of Minuteman Library Network locations, and consider this to be a useful and fair sample for my purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s roll:</p>\n\n<h3>1. Acton</h3>\n\n<h2>3/3!</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/ebDk2UJ.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The site is visually appealing and clear at the same time. I immediately got an answer to my question. Success!</p>\n\n<h3>2. Arlington (Robbins Library)</h3>\n\n<h2>0/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/CpqOqdR.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Hours are clearly listed, but the holiday is not. Based on this page, I would assume it is open today\u200a\u2014\u200ain fact, the clear listing of hours reinforces my wrong assumption. To see the holiday announcement, I would need to know to visit the Calendar. A shame, because the site looks quite polished to me and was likely re-designed fairly recently (guessing 2013, from its footer). An investment in a bit of user testing and research would have likely fixed this.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Ashland</h3>\n\n<h2>Huh? 0.5/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/yQ2dOww.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>While there is no indication of library closure today, the Townhall is clearly  closed. As a local, I might know what that means for my library trip, so I gave 0.5 points for at least mentioning the holiday exists.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Bedford</h3>\n\n<h2>0/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/XhAfaNt.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Today\u2019s closure is not mentioned anywhere. Neither are the regular hours. I would look  either in About Us, or (eventually) see a link for Hours &amp; Directions close to the top right.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Belmont</h3>\n\n<h2>3/3!</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/inJbhUs.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The site doesn\u2019t look like much, but it accomplishes my goal today perfectly. The library is clearly closed.</p>\n\n<h3>6. Brookline</h3>\n\n<h2>3/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/jpBCY9k.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>This library goes beyond my expectations by clearly listing not only today\u2019s closure, but the entire holiday weekend for all three of its locations. The \u201cClosed\u201d notice is clear and immediately jumps to my attention. While there is no \u201cclosed TODAY\u201d notice, I found this more detailed listing works just as well.</p>\n\n<h3>7. Cambridge</h3>\n\n<h2>0/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/QVg8HQO.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>This library was a particular disappointment, because I have used it many times and the collection and its building are delightful. I am assuming it is one of the better funded libraries, given its location in direct proximity to Harvard. While the amount of content this page needs to show may be far greater than what a smaller local library deals with, this is no excuse for making things difficult to find. I get the feeling that the structure of the site is based on internal objectives, rather than user goals.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s where today\u2019s closure information is, in fact, located:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/W4eopoE.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I would have to do this:\n- \u201cfind library hours\u201d on the homepage\n- select \u201cholidays\u201d among eleven listings\n- see on the list that today, January 19th, is a holiday</p>\n\n<h3>8. Concord</h3>\n\n<h2>0/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/zH7HVUy.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>No indication of whether it is open today. The latest news seems to be the New Year\u2019s.</p>\n\n<h3>9. Dedham</h3>\n\n<h2>3/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/8qHlEVH.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>It is immediately clear that the library is closed today.</p>\n\n<h3>10. Dover</h3>\n\n<h2>2/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/ZmLY9lq.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>There is a clear indication that the library is closed today. I had to scan the page for a while and read a few things before I noticed it, so it was not obvious.</p>\n\n<h3>11. Framingham</h3>\n\n<h2>2.5/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/3j83pAP.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>It was almost obvious that \u201call libraries will be closed\u201d today\u200a\u2014\u200aeven on this crowded page. I was distracted by the email sign-up notice, but the next thing I read was the closure notice. Not pretty, but close to functional.</p>\n\n<h3>12. Franklin</h3>\n\n<h2>0/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/9CnV6Uv.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The public library website seems to be just a layer of content on top of the Franklin local government site. Very confusing. No indication of closure.</p>\n\n<h3>13. Holliston</h3>\n\n<h2>2.5/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/UNEAehM.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I found the closure information quickly, but it did not stand out enough (for my taste) from other news.</p>\n\n<h3>14. Lexington</h3>\n\n<h2>3.5/3</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/n6IeQHX.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The first indication of the library closure for MLK is in the featured image. It eventually changes to another feature, but there is a second indicator (Today\u2019s hours: CLOSED) that makes the situation obvious. This fall-back \u201cclosed\u201d notice got this site an extra\u00a0.5 points on my scale.</p>\n\n<h2>What did I miss?</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, this is a very small test for a very specific user need. The sites that did well on my scale for \u201cclosing hours\u201d may fail miserably at providing an answer to \u201cwhat\u2019s the street address?\u201d or \u201ccan I renew my book online?\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>This test reiterated for me the importance of research and real-life user testing. Knowing what problems people might try to solve by going to a website, and where the site fails them, is necessary for most any meaningful improvement.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2>How not to miss things:</h2>\n\n<p>As a designer, I am often excited by a problem I see, and can jump to a solution I consider to be self-evident. (<em>The page is too crowded. Let\u2019s change the typeface and layout!</em>) But to make my solutions truly useful to other people, I must know what they need.</p>\n\n<p>In this example, I am a user with a specific need. Designers do not often start working on a project with solid knowledge of user needs. To bridge this gap, we test the current product (if it exists), create personas and scenarios, and ask lots of questions.</p>\n\n<p>Research could have prevented the \u201cis the library closed?\u201d problem. If there was one question I could ask people,  it would be \u201cWhat was the most frustrating thing about this library?\u201d Out of many responses, I would imagine at least one would mention showing up at the library to find it closed. Asking these types of general questions, not <em>\u201chow satisfied are you with the library website? (on a scale from one to ten)\u201d</em>, will eventually lead us to meaningful design.</p>\n\n<p>Or, at least, save us the frustration of showing up to a closed library.</p>\n","summary":"Ask good questions to solve for real user goals","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design","observations","user-experience"],"date":"2015-01-20T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/01/16/joining-dockyard","title":"Joining DockYard","dockyarder":"estelle-deblois","body":"<p>Six months ago today, I signed the letter officially accepting the offer\nto join DockYard as a Senior Developer. It was the best decision I could have made.</p>\n\n<p>When I announced my resignation to my previous employer, he jokingly said that if\nthey had known choosing Ember as a new client-side framework would\neventually make me want to pursue a new Ember-focused opportunity, they would\nhave chosen Angular.</p>\n\n<p>I first started dipping my toes into Ember in late Spring 2013, some time after\nEmber 1.0 RC3 was released. The Ember.js community was undeniably very active and\nvibrant. That following June, I attended my first Boston Ember meetup,\nwhere <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dgeb\">Dan Gebhardt</a> shared tips on testing Ember apps,\nand <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twokul\">Alex Navasardyan</a> gave an introduction to Ember Data.\nThat&#39;s how I came to know of DockYard.</p>\n\n<p>Soon, some names started to emerge as familiar names within the\ncommunity. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bcardarella\">Brian Cardarella</a> became\nknown within our dev team as the one who wrote\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-validations\">ember-validations</a>,\nwhich we were using in our application. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rwjblue\">Robert\nJackson</a> was another name that kept popping\nup on my Twitter and GitHub feeds. Call me a nerd if you will, but I was\nas excited to have The Robert Jackson accept a fix that I submitted to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/emberjs/ember-dev\">ember-dev</a> later that year to make builds\npass on Windows (with Rake at the time) as I would have been meeting a film celebrity.</p>\n\n<p>DockYard further reinforced its reputation by organizing the Wicked Good Ember\nconference in Boston, in June of 2014, which I of course attended.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, when Brian reached out to me last July about joining the team, I\nsaw it as an opportunity that was really hard to pass on. Logistically,\nI may have been better off staying where I was. I had a 40 min commute.\nJoining DockYard would have doubled my commuting time. I was also\ncomfortable with the position I was holding, building out cool D3.js\ncharts with Ember, leading the development of new products, and getting\nmyself involved in all kinds of engineering team growth efforts. But\nthen there was DockYard. I went with my gut feeling instead and left\nthe warm and comfortable seat to face the exciting, though new and scary thing that was\nDockYard.</p>\n\n<p>Scary? Yes. From everything DockYard had done for the Boston community\nto the talent behind its wheel, I was absolutely terrified of not\nfitting in, that it was too elite for me. I checked out the team page on\nthe website and read everyone&#39;s biography a number of times,\ntrying to picture what kind of co-workers I would be interacting with\ndaily. No matter how great the projects can be, culture is a big thing.\nTo my delight, the culture at DockYard is one that resonates the\nmost with me in my 10 years of professional career.</p>\n\n<p>DockYard has a well-balanced team of young, bright minds and more\nseasoned developers, and I embrace that. There is none of that &quot;I am\nbetter than you&quot; bullshit. Those I once viewed as Ember Gods and would\nhave been intimidated to talk to have been incredibly supportive and encouraging.\nIn the past, whenever I was involved in the hiring process for\nEngineering, I had always wondered where all the great developers were.\nWell, they&#39;re here, happily employed at places like DockYard. If there\nis one thing I can say about the company, it&#39;s that it&#39;s doing something\nright to attract an amazingly talented and diverse crew. I&#39;ve been\nparticularly impressed with our designers. It&#39;s nice as a developer to\nwork on such nifty UIs!</p>\n\n<p>Doing consultancy work was new to me, and I had been warned about what I was\nthrowing myself into, that I&#39;d end up losing focus on quality and just\nhack solutions together quickly to meet client deadlines. I don&#39;t doubt\nthat those kinds of situations can creep up, but so far, I&#39;ve found\nquite the opposite in the two projects that I&#39;ve been involved in.\nPeople care deeply about delivering clean, maintainable,\nand well-tested code, and they&#39;ve been especially adept at maintaining those\nprinciples throughout the life of a project.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also refreshing to be able to work on a diverse portfolio of\nprojects. In the first few months since joining DockYard, I worked on a Rails and Ember app\nthat incorporated some really cool geolocation functionality. I am now\nworking on something that is unlike any other app I have ever developed.\nThe project includes Arduino code, Ember.js, and Node WebKit\n(<a href=\"http://nwjs.io/\">NW.js</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The best, of course, is DockYard&#39;s mindset towards open source. I always\nlook forward to our &quot;DockYard days&quot; on Fridays to hack on code, blog\n(this is my first one!), contribute back to the community in some ways,\nor just to level up our craftsmanship.</p>\n\n<p>And as much as everyone works really hard, we also know when to have\nfun, be it through Risk game tournaments, friendly games of Carcassonne\n(or, as some would say, &quot;Casserole&quot;), or world exploring and building on\nMinecraft.</p>\n\n<p>Finding a job that you&#39;ll love can be hard. Finding a team that you&#39;ll\nlove working with can be twice as hard. And sometimes, it&#39;s okay\nto leave behind what is comfortable and secure, in light of\nsomething promising, yet unknown. You may be pleasantly surprised.</p>\n","summary":"Reflections on the past few months of being employed at DockYard","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["jobs","culture","team"],"date":"2015-01-16T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/01/14/sr-ui-designer","title":"Job: Senior UI & Visual Designer","dockyarder":"steven-trevathan","body":"<p>We are looking for the next addition to our design team.</p>\n\n<p>The ideal candidate is someone who can demonstrate a strong user-centric approach to their work, cares deeply about how their work will ultimately function, has been part of the user research process in the past, and shows strength in typography, color, and information layout.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re a design-driven software consultancy with design projects typically lasting 2-4 months.

There are many small and large annoyances that come with a live construction site nearby. One thing has been particularly awkward: access to our restrooms.</p>\n\n<p>As you might suspect, most if not all construction workers are men. There is active pipe work going on in the building, so they often need to do work directly inside the women&#39;s restroom at random times throughout the day. We would discover that a man is working on a ceiling duct in a space we expected to be for women only, and it has caused a considerable amount of tension.</p>\n\n<p>While there may be many alternatives to doing construction work like this without warning, with less disruption of our work day, I had also started to question why this behavior felt like such an intrusion. After all, there are covered stalls with doors that go down close to the ground, so there&#39;s still a significant amount of privacy.</p>\n\n<p>The reason seems to be not the exposure itself, but the fact that a certain space (e.g. beyond the door that says &quot;WOMEN&quot;) has been designated for a specific use, and is limited to one gender. This situation is not default - in fact, there are a few alternatives:</p>\n\n<p>Often located in smaller restaurants or coffee shops, a single-user bathroom normally does not have a gender restriction. One would simply wait for it to be vacant, and use it without a second thought.</p>\n\n<p>A &quot;family&quot; bathroom (explicitly marked as such) is for one or many users. It is roomier than the &quot;regular&quot; bathrooms next to it, and normally utilized by a parent with children, or someone using a wheelchair. Few eyebrows would be raised when several people at once, regardless of gender, walk out.</p>\n\n<p>At MOMA PS1 there is an explicitly declared unisex shared restroom. It has three stalls (with doors) and a urinal facing the back wall. It is a bit unsettling to use for the first time, but the explicit declaration makes it feel like a shared awkward experience, rather than a disadvantage of one group of people or another.</p>\n\n<p>In summary - our expectations always determine what we consider to be unacceptable. The example of bathrooms in our office building clearly shows that a construction worker&#39;s expectation (&quot;this is my work site&quot;) and my female co-workers&#39; expectation (&quot;this is a space for women only&quot;) did not line up. More importantly, both parties were &quot;right&quot; in their own way. </p>\n\n<p>To me as a designer, this awkward situation clearly illustrates how important it is to understand a client&#39;s or a colleague&#39;s expectations in any given situation.

His studio has done many architecture monographs, because the format lends itself well to carefully considered custom design. (Architects with lots of work to show also tend to have the budget for and interest in such things.)</p>\n\n<h2>Formats in print</h2>\n\n<p>A key concept in his book design process is the selection of an appropriate medium, or format, for each type of content. He explained that with enough analysis, the materials from which a book is to be made can clearly be separated by type of content. For example, photographs of completed buildings are one type, and architectural drawings of incomplete or conceptual projects\u200a\u2014\u200aanother. Once the separation is made, the next logical step is to select the best format for each type of content, with sensitivity to its beautiful representation. Type of paper, ink, printing methods, folding and binding possibilities all become variables in an equation, which can have a logical and aesthetic solution.</p>\n\n<p><em>Barents Lessons</em> is a book based on a trip that a group of students took to the Barents Sea.\n(All images via <a href=\"http://www.ludovic-balland.ch/\">ludovic-balland.ch</a>)\n<img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/blog-books-and-web-design-01.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>This book consists of three sections, with three distinct formats. The first\u200a\u2014\u200aAnalysis\u200a\u2014\u200ais text, meant for long form reading.\n<img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/blog-books-and-web-design-02.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>It is followed by a section of detailed maps. Colors were individually selected to take advantage of the cartographic detail. For this and other projects, Ludovic\u2019s studio often completely re-draws graphics like this all in a consistent style for the book, which they then can print at the highest quality.\n<img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/blog-books-and-web-design-03.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The final section holds student photographs. They are shown in an order determined by the value of the photo: from dark to light, avoiding forced storylines between photographs that do not necessarily relate to each other. The paper selection has changed once again, and the photos are given full prominence with minimal captions.\n<img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/blog-books-and-web-design-04.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I find this book to be a great example of logical and thoughtful design: content is well supported and enhanced through the technology of book production. Everything, from the binding, to the paper, to the colors and page layouts, supports the content of the book. I also think it\u2019s a strong parallel to the use of technology to support users, and the things they want to do, when we build products on the web.</p>\n\n<h2>Formats on the web</h2>\n\n<p>While technology allows us to make things respond in a specific manner to an action, to show only the necessary things to the right person, or to add delightful and playful details to already common tasks, it is the thoughtful and often economical selection of the \u201cformats\u201d we use on the web that makes for a strong, impactful project.</p>\n\n<p>For example, using Ember.js - <a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2015/01/07/complex-search-pages-feel-better-in-ember.html\">a technology that allows us to change portions of a web page without reloading the entire thing</a> - allows us to enhance a search page very effectively. We could use the same technology to enhance a gallery type page (whose primary purpose is to show static content) but the improvement would be marginal and not cost effective. The <a href=\"http://www.indexhibit.org/what-who-why-how/\">Inexhibit platform</a> focuses on <em>\u201ca community of users who place emphasis on content over complicated website design\u201d</em> and offers a minimal tool for artists to create a gallery and show their work.</p>\n\n<p>We can always add technology to marginally improve the experience. We could also print newspapers on higher quality paper, but the format would conflict with the nature of a newspaper as a frequently updated disposable item. </p>\n\n<p>Our ability to select the appropriate format, or technology, for a task reflects our deep understanding of the content and the problem we are solving. The rejection of unnecessary improvements is an important decision. It makes our work efficient and focused.</p>\n","summary":"Really understand your content, then select its format.","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design","observations"],"date":"2015-01-13T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2015/01/11/why-is-google-ignoring-over-400000-backlinks","title":"Why is Google ignoring over 400,000 backlinks to DockYard?","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>Imagine our enthusiasm when the opportunity to add hundreds of thousands\nof backlinks from one of the web&#39;s most popular library hosting websites\nback to our domain came our way.

We were contacted by\n<a href=\"http://rubycentral.org\">RubyCentral</a> about 9 months prior. I was\ninterested in this opportunity for three reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It gave DockYard the opportunity to give back to the Ruby community,\none that has been so pivotal to our growth early on (and one that has\nbeen pivotal to my growth as a professional engineer for nearly 10\nyears)</li>\n<li>DockYard can show off its design talents to the community</li>\n<li>DockYard would get a <em>&quot;Designed By&quot;</em> sponsor link at the bottom of\nevery page.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This blog post is going to explore the third reason and the result of\nthis over the past two months.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of launch RubyGems.org had over 90,000 gems published. This\nmeant a sponsor link at the bottom of every page that was backlinking\nto <a href=\"http://dockyard.com\">DockYard.com</a>. In addition to the landing page\nand the other static pages. This was an appealing value to gain from a\nre-design effort. According to Google&#39;s own backlink search DockYard had\nonly 65 pages linking back. This struck me as odd considering this blog\nitself links back to DockYard.com and there were more than 65 posts. But\nsurely after the redesign this number should go up. Our estimated\nPageRank was <code>5</code>.</p>\n\n<p>After the redesign we saw the expected spike in traffic</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tpcgGpK.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Checking in on the referrals we can see that to date we have received\nover 600 referrals from RubyGems.org.

And I admit that\nSEO is not something I&#39;ve very good at. But if I were to look at another\nbacklink source such as\n<a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/subdomains/?target=dockyard.com\">ahrefs</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tlHt3sK.png\" alt=\"ahrefs\"></p>\n\n<p>You can clearly see the spike in referring pages. A <strong>huge</strong> jump from\nnearly nothing to over 400,000. The bottom graph shows that these are\nprimarly <em>DoFollow</em> links.</p>\n\n<p>So these backlinks aren&#39;t being counted by Google? Does Google only count\none domain per backlink? Color me confused. I suspect we&#39;re doing\nsomething wrong on our end to not get any credit. Could it be that such\na huge spike in backlinks are flagged as suspicious by Google?

The more rules we could put in place\nregarding naming conventions, the better. What I didn&rsquo;t understand\nwas what to do when an element could be considered an element of a block <em>or</em> a\nmodifier. If I had a button that was in the footer and it was styled differently\nthan other buttons in the website, should it be named <code>.footer__button</code>\nor <code>.button--footer</code>? Arguments could be made for both sides, so is one better\nthan the other?</p>\n\n<p>After trying out both ways, <code>.footer__button</code> proved more scalable because\nthis rule could be consistently applied in more situations. Could there\nbe more types of buttons in the footer?\nIf there are also social buttons in the footer, our choices now become\n<code>.footer__button--social</code> or <code>.button--footer--social</code>. In the second one, is social modifying\nfooter and footer modifying button? Or is social modifying button as\nwell? To avoid confusion, I would call it <code>.footer__button--social</code>\nand not chain my modifiers. This doesn&rsquo;t mean we\nshouldn&rsquo;t use multiple modifiers in a class name at all.\n<code>.person--female__hand--right</code> is still fair game. It&rsquo;s clear that female\nis modifying person and right is modifying hand.</p>\n\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n\n<p>If I had an element that could potentially be either an element of a\nblock or modifying an element, the latter is better because\nchaining modifiers can be confusing.</p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["css"],"date":"2015-01-05T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/12/30/modeling-mental-models","title":"Tips on Mental Models","dockyarder":"steven-trevathan","body":"<p>Just as a single color can have conflicting associations between different cultures, mental models can vary widely between users. If you haven\u2019t heard of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model\">mental models</a>, they are a beholder\u2019s mental image of a designed object and how it may be interfaced with. </p>\n\n<p>Understanding the mental models your users have created of your product (or similar product experiences) is important. It will help you improve either by adjusting the product to better fit their mental model or by changing the users\u2019 mental model to better fit your product. Neither are simple.</p>\n\n<p>To give you a sense of how a mental model is constructed or applied to a product, let&#39;s imagine looking at a new object in extreme slow motion:</p>\n\n<p>The object is placed before you. The first thing you notice is its size and shape. It\u2019s small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, thin, and rectangular in shape. Its color is off-white. In this first glance you might make some general assumptions about the object\u2019s nature and function, but given that there are countless objects that could share these qualities, your observation continues. </p>\n\n<p>On the grey rectangle you can clearly see a small red button, a small green button, a large square button, and a series of small grey buttons in a familiar 3x3 grid. Given that the device is small enough to fit in your hand, has multiple buttons, and lacks a screen, you might conclude that it\u2019s a remote of some kind. And you might stop there, unless you actually have to use the remote.</p>\n\n<p>While making these observations, your brain was building a mental model of how to interact with it by referencing past experiences with similar objects. Taking the path of least resistance, your brain wants to reapply these models wherever and whenever it can. You won\u2019t need to re-teach yourself how to use something you\u2019ve consistently used over the years unless something significantly breaks the pattern. With each connection you make with familiar and unfamiliar qualities of the object, either consciously or not, you pave ways to interpret the purpose, value, and effectiveness of the object.</p>\n\n<p>The speed with which we identify these things correlates to how similar the object is in form to other objects we\u2019re familiar with. The models you create as a user aren\u2019t originating solely with the object in front you; instead they are created from all the objects you\u2019ve ever interacted with. This is where understanding and employing mental models gains value in design. We can use them to manipulate, speed up, or slow down interpretation of our products.</p>\n\n<p>The information and interpretations from that first glance are all gleaned with relatively low effort, almost instantaneous, and you\u2019re not always aware that you are making these evaluations. However, a unique object often takes a conscious effort to understand. If the object wasn\u2019t very well designed to reveal its own function you may instead have exhausted yourself with a seemingly uninterpretable thing and given up.</p>\n\n<h2>Borrowing</h2>\n\n<p>We sometimes borrow mental models from unrelated or contextually irrelevant experiences because some aspect of what we are interacting with may have unconsciously reminded us of previous experiences. A thing isn\u2019t always what we think it is.</p>\n\n<p>Because we are all somewhat responsible for building our own mental models from our experiences with the designed world, our interpretations of an object\u2019s purpose or quality of performance can vary greatly. I think this is part of the reason why reviews of products are so polarized. People\u2019s expectations and preferences are different, and sometimes they just aren\u2019t able to build a fitting mental model of the product. So they\u2019ll borrow it.</p>\n\n<p>If the object is truly unique, layers of mystery may remain for a broad user base. Thus, there may be limits to how they have evaluated the object\u2019s purpose. As designers, we don\u2019t need to hold ourselves responsible for explaining everything, but it is important to get a user to as complete an understanding as possible using the object\u2019s form alone. No language, no manuals, no tutorials. No automatically playing videos after they log in for the first time.</p>\n\n<h2>Against the grain</h2>\n\n<p>Going against the grain of a mental model is generally a bad idea, but it can be valuable. It should be by design, of course, and might provide some comparative market value and interest. An example of this working was the introduction of the iPod and its very unique interface (the wheel) while competitors had basically indistinguishable and boring (by comparison) arrow key pads. The iPod might have been a little more difficult to use, but the innovative design wasn\u2019t enough of a challenge to stop people from using it. Instead the change helped Apple greatly differentiate their product from other MP3 players.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when you go against the grain for no good reason? Lots of avoidable and silly mistakes, that\u2019s what. Take this remote for our projector as an example.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/post-assets/steve/mental-models-remote.jpg\" alt=\"A very frustrating projector remote\">\n<em>For emphasis, I\u2019ve erased the small labels generally ignored by users when turning the projector on or off.</em></p>\n\n<p>We know it\u2019s a remote at first glance because we\u2019ve used them before. The shape seems to suggest both purpose and a direction for use. Which end of the remote would you point toward the projector?</p>\n\n<p>If you said you\u2019d point it with the slanted side forward and the red button in the upper right, you would have found on your first (and second, and third) attempt that this remote\u2019s form does not align with your mental model. With this particular design, you are expected to hold the remote with the red button positioned on the bottom left. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the mental model I have for remotes is not matched to the device because the manufacturer ignored a common design pattern without apparent reason, adding only momentary confusion, rather than enhanced functionality, to my experience.</p>\n\n<h1>Last words on defining (and refining) your models</h1>\n\n<p>When designing your product, be aware of your users\u2019 mental models and recognize that your own will be very different from theirs. This is an overwhelmingly common mistake.</p>\n\n<p>You should also be aware of user and market contexts to judge what aspects of their models you may break and which you should keep. Don\u2019t break the model just to be different if the difference provides no value or delightful experience for a user.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, designers must understand that users will have wildly varying points of reference, so presumed models need to be tested with multiple different users before the direction of the product design is settled upon. Failure to do this will put the success of the product at risk.</p>\n","summary":"A few things to keep in mind.","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design","design-process","design-thinking"],"date":"2014-12-30T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/12/28/lessons-learned-three-years-running-a-software-consultancy","title":"Lessons Learned - Three years of running a software consultancy","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>This year&#39;s story is one of how we nearly went out of business <em>twice</em> yet\nstill managed to pull off our most successful year yet.</p>\n\n<h2>People</h2>\n\n<p>In 2013, we ended the year with 11 employees. We made a key hire at the start of the year with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/rwjblue\">Robert\nJackson</a> joining us. I had met Robert a few\nmonths prior at <a href=\"http://burlingtonrubyconference.com/\">Burlington Ruby\nConf</a>. Robert had been\ncontributing to a few of our Ember libraries, as well as making a name\nfor himself by quickly moving up the contributors list in Ember.js\nitself. Less than four months after we hired Robert he was welcomed onto\nthe Ember.js Core Team. I&#39;m extremely proud of him accomplishing\nthat.</p>\n\n<p>We added depth to our design team in Q1 2014 with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/rgbcolor\">Maria Matveeva</a>\nand <a href=\"http://twitter.com/imakemusic\">Tim Walsh</a>. Tim and Maria have been\ninvaluable for us, their dedication and ability allows you to easily\nforget how young they are. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how they\ncontinue to grow in 2015.</p>\n\n<p>Early in 2014, we hired our first Project Manager, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jon_lacks\">Jon\nLacks</a>. Jon and I went to college\ntogether, and historically I have not had a good run of\nworking with friends. That has been my fault, I think I was more\ninterested in working with people I was friends with than establishing\nwhat their responsibilities would be. Jon and I agreed that any and all\npotential issues that may arise that could conflict with our prior\nrelationship should be aired out immediately. Jon joined\nDockYard in February and spent the first month or so observing our team\nmore than taking complete ownership of our process. I gradually handed\noff some of what I was managing to Jon (running standups, getting involved with\nsome client meetings, helping with estimations). All this to say that\nadding a dedicated PM was one of the highest impact decisions I made in\n2014. I suspect that many companies don&#39;t need one until they&#39;re around\n10 people in size but once you do hire one you&#39;ll be thankful.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/i_am_romina\">Romina Vargas</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Linstula\">Lin Reid</a> were two engineers that went through our\nintern program and we upgraded them to full-time as soon as we could.\nBoth Lin &amp; Romina have been important members of some of our larger\nclients projects in 2014.</p>\n\n<p>Marin Abernethy, a former engineering intern, came back for her third (and final)\ninternship with us after her graduation from college.\nIn the Fall we hired her as a full-time engineer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/netopwibby\">Paul Webb</a> interviewed with us in early 2014 but we had some projects\nfall through and things got very tight for us (more on this later) so we\nhad to pass. But as soon as we had the bandwidth we brought Paul onboard\nto our UX Development team.</p>\n\n<p>Heading into the Summer, we started to get spread a little thin on the\nengineering team. I had come off of client work completely to focus on\nthe business so we needed another Senior level engineer. I reached out\nto <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edeblois\">Estelle DeBlois</a>, who had come to our\n<a href=\"http://wickedgoodember.com\">Wicked Good Ember</a> conference in June.\nShe&#39;s been lead developer for one of our larger clients over the past\nfew months.</p>\n\n<p>Our final hire starts full-time with us in January. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ashleytreni\">Ashley\nTreni</a> was actually tending bar at\n<a href=\"http://www.highballboston.com/\">Highball Lounge</a> right next door to our\noffice (they can see us, we can see them). She asked what we did and it\nturns out that she is an amazing designer who was completing her Masters\nin Information Design and Visualization at Northeastern. She did a summer internship with us and\naccepted our offer for full-time employment just recently.</p>\n\n<h3>Hiring is hard</h3>\n\n<p>Hiring continues to be hard. We have had success by focusing on\ntechnology niches, but we may have tapped that out. Going into 2015, we\nwill have to consider how do we reach out and attract top talent,\n<em>and</em> how do we improve the existing talent we have. Promoting from within\nis something I&#39;ve talked a big game about but have done little with.\nThis will change in 2015.</p>\n\n<p>I began 2014 with the same trend I had in the previous two years: I\nwould hire good people even if we didn&#39;t have projects to put them on.\nComing out of Q1 2014, I had to stop this immediately. While we had built\nup a great team, the weight of that payroll and our lack of cashflow at\nthe time was at a breaking point where I could no longer cover the\ndifference by taking myself off salary. Since then I have been very\nconservative with hiring. Unfortunately we actually missed out on some\ngreat people because of this, and I regret that as I was perhaps <em>too</em>\nconservative in our hiring at the time. Heading into 2015, this will\nprobably continue to be an aspect of the company I will continue to\nimprove.</p>\n\n<h3>Firing still sucks</h3>\n\n<p>I had to fire two employees in 2014. Firing always sucks and I don&#39;t\nthink I&#39;ll ever get used to it. There is a guilt that is attached that\nat some point is out-weighed by whatever you&#39;re not getting from said\nemployee. So how does one mitigate the guilt? <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664?ref=https://gigaom.com/2013/01/29/netflix-company-culture/\">Netflix has a great\npolicy when it comes to firing\nemployees</a>.\nThe document outlines their full cultural philosophy but the gist of how\nthey fire is that they give a very generous severance package. So\nmanagers don&#39;t concern themselves with the guilt what will happen to\nthis employee without their job. I think this is a great idea, but not\nalways practical for all companies. If we had Netflix money then I would\ndefinitely align our severance package with theirs.</p>\n\n<h3>Culture</h3>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve done a lot of work to define what the culture of DockYard actually\nis. Until Q4 2014 our culture was never written in stone. So we took\nsome time to put it into words:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>strong problem solvers, with attention to detail</li>\n<li>coachable learners and willing mentors</li>\n<li>professional, kind and respectful</li>\n<li>collaborative team players</li>\n<li>disciplined</li>\n<li>reputation</li>\n<li>diverse</li>\n<li>fun</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re looking at this list and thinking &quot;yeah this is pretty much what every company will say&quot;.\nThat could be true, but these are going to be our hiring and retention criteria. We will be building a team around \nthese principles and expect everyone at DockYard to live up to them.</p>\n\n<h3>Heading into next year</h3>\n\n<p>We have a goal of expanding our team to over 25 by the end of 2015. I\nwould actually prefer to be closer to 30. Our hiring will be focused on\nSenior Level talent for engineering, design, and UX. We&#39;re always interested\nin <a href=\"mailto:jobs@dockyard.com\">hearing from great people, get in touch if you&#39;re\ninterested</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Estimations</h2>\n\n<p>Our problems with maintaining our estimations were not significantly\nimproving in early 2014. We had to eat a lot of money on contracts that\nwas due either to bad estimations or our inability to properly manage our\nclients. If we ever expected to build a real company, this had to be\nfixed. This is where Jon came in as our first Project Managing hire. It\ntook a few months but we&#39;ve gone from being consistently late to being\nconsistently early. Our estimations are currently one of the more\nreliable aspects of our business. This has not just helped relationships\nwith existing clients but being able to reliably sell our services to\nnew clients is incredibly powerful.</p>\n\n<h3>Heading into the next year</h3>\n\n<p>I suspect we will continue to hone our ability to estimate. We will also\nbe looking to hire an additional Project Manager as we decided we don&#39;t\never want to spread a PM over more than three projects.</p>\n\n<h2>Financials</h2>\n\n<p>In 2013 we ended the year with $1.7m in revenue with about 20% profit\nmargin. This year we improved that to $3.1 in revenue with 33% profit\nmargin. This is a significant jump, in many ways I&#39;m incredibly proud of\nwhat we were able to accomplish this year. However, I also know that we\n(as a company) underperformed. If we had been as productive in the first\nhalf of the year as we were in the second half we should have been\ncloser to a $4m+ company with &gt;50% profit margin.</p>\n\n<h3>What went wrong</h3>\n\n<p>We were getting contracts coming in through the year, but nothing with\nthe challenge or scope that I was hoping for. Small $50k contracts here\nand there. I like working on small projects but from a business\nperspective we were burning too much time negotiating contracts,\nbalancing people on and off between contracts. I was butting heads with\nour business developer. He and I had different ideas on how to run the\ncompany. The funny thing is that neither of us were wrong. He wanted to\nreduce price due to lack of the demand we had at the time. I didn&#39;t want\nto do that. I was willing to pass on contracts that we could have\ngotten if we cut our rate 25%. This eventually put us in a position of\nbringing in 0% of billings for more than 50% of the company rather than\n75% of billings. Which would you rather have?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure there are people reading this was a deeper background in\nrunning a business than saying it was stupid not to take the 75%. Here\nis my problem: at that amount we weren&#39;t making any profit and our\npeople were tied up on projects. I was tired of living hand to mouth, I\nhad taken myself off of payroll consistently for the past few years. I\nwas living off my wife&#39;s salary.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of Q1 I was looking down the barrel of DockYard and not\nliking what I was seeing. Then we got a whale of a contract come our\nway. This was a contract that could right the ship. Or so I thought.</p>\n\n<p>I was not heading up the contract negotiations. The only criteria I gave\nwas what I thought our rate should be for this contract. When it came to\nit our business developer was not confident that we could get that rate.\nI was distraught. I was not willing to lock DockYard into a long-term\ncontract at cost. I told my wife at dinner I was going to start looking\nfor a &quot;real job&quot; and that DockYard was finished.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t sleep. I stayed up and kept mulling over the contract, was this\nit? I came to several conclusions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The client could afford our rate.</li>\n<li>We were worth the rate.</li>\n<li>Our business developer did not believe in #2</li>\n<li>I should be handling contract negotiations for DockYard</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I came into work that morning. Within a span of 15 minutes I fired our\nbusiness developer and landed the client at the rate we felt we\ndeserved.</p>\n\n<p>I realize the above might seem indifferent to letting someone go. He and\nI actually got along very well on a personal level. But as I mentioned\npreviously when it came to how to run DockYard we didn&#39;t see eye to eye.\nI was stressing out over this constantly and in the event I was not able\nto land this client on my own at the very least I could say that I went\nout my way. Egotistical? Yes, of course. But it is something I needed to\ndo. If we had slowly died over the rest of 2014 due to no real profit\nmargin I would have quit.</p>\n\n<p>This was the first of two near-deaths for DockYard this year. The second\nwould come just two months later.</p>\n\n<p>The large client came with a large legal team, one that I was unprepared\nfor handling properly. We have an excellent lawyer we&#39;re working with\nbut I am accustomed to contract negotiation taking maybe a week. This\ntook months to complete.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with dealing with Enterprise companies is that they can\noutlast you. It isn&#39;t their intent to do so, it is in their best\ninterest that their vendors are able to work on what they need to the\nbest of the vendor&#39;s ability. It doesn&#39;t help either party if the vendor\ncan&#39;t make payroll. However, because of how many Enterprise companies\nare structured, and who has to sign off on what, an unprepared small\nvendor can be put into a position of agreeing to some things that are not\nin its best interest so it can start getting paid ASAP.</p>\n\n<p>I was perhaps too  risky in this regard. I held out on the contract, I\nput it through multiple rounds of negotionation. There was some legit\nscary stuff in it that I was not willing to agree to. We had started\nwork with the client before the contract was completed. At the time I\ndidn&#39;t consider this to be a big risk.</p>\n\n<p>What happened was that there was little to no incentive to speed up the\ncontract signing for our client. We were working, doing what they\nwanted, and they had no obligation to pay us. I realize some of you are\nreading this and thinking &quot;Rookie Move!&quot; but consider the context.\nStarting work with large clients prior to contracts being completed is\nactually a common practice in the Enterprise. I hear some of you\nscreaming &quot;no it isn&#39;t!&quot;. Yes, it is.</p>\n\n<p>We ran out of money. We had a payroll that we were $25k short for. I had\na very difficult conversation with the client and made the tough\ndecision to stop work until the contract was signed and our existing\ninvoices were immediately covered. I made a personal loan to DockYard to\ncover payroll. (as a side-note, banks never loan you money when you need\nit) Thankfully the client saw the situation for what it was and we were\nable to move forward. This was in June.</p>\n\n<p>Putting the brakes on the project and getting the contract done and\ngetting paid was the turning point for DockYard. We went from invoicing\non average $30k/week to over $100k/week. With no contract longer than\nNet-30 by August we had all of our debts paid off and were in a position\nto hire again. By November we had gone from a 1% profit margin for the\nyear in June to over 25%.</p>\n\n<p>It is actually strange writing about this now, and I&#39;m not entirely\ncertain I should have written all of this. In some ways it was one of\nthe most stressful times in my life, and looking back it feels surreal.</p>\n\n<p>I hope there are some nuggets of knowledge in here to help others avoid\na similar situation.</p>\n\n<h3>Heading into next year</h3>\n\n<p>We have ambitious financial goals. We aim for a $5m+ business in 2015. A\n$10m+ business in 2016, each year with &gt;25% margin. If we can maintain our current momentum we\nshould easily meet 2015&#39;s goal.</p>\n\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n\n<h3>Ember.js</h3>\n\n<p>We bet very heavily on <a href=\"http://emberjs.com\">Ember.js</a> in 2013. That bet\nhas paid off very well for us in 2014. The client mentioned above hired\nus for our expertise in Ember.js. We landed another great client in the\nSummer because of Ember.js. We are seeing a steady flow of work come in\nbecause of Ember.js but I don&#39;t think we can meet our $5m goal by\nrelying on inbound leads from Ember.js.</p>\n\n<p>One thing we&#39;ve never dealt with is selling our services into another\ncompany. We&#39;ve got most work by companies making a technology decision then\nfinding who is good at working with said technology. How do you convince\na company unfamiliar with Ember.js that it is what they should use to\nbuild their product with? What if this person is not technology savvy?</p>\n\n<p>I came to the conclusion that you cannot sell Ember.js directly. I\nneeded help with building a sales pipeline and sales pitch. A friend put\nme in touch with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/lorne-cooper/0/9a6/811\">Lorne\nCooper</a> who I have\nbeen working with over the past two months. Lorne convinced me that I\nhad sales backwards. We need to start with Marketing. (he also convinced\nme that I couldn&#39;t sell Ember.js)</p>\n\n<p>So what we built was the DockYard marketing funnel. Working backwards\nfrom Ember.js, we broadened the funnel. If the answer is: <strong>Ember.js</strong>\nthen the question should be <strong>What is the best Single Page App\nframework?</strong> (let&#39;s save tech debates for another time). I didn&#39;t feel\nthat selling SPAs was any better than selling Ember.js. Again, the\nanswer is <strong>Single Page Apps</strong> so the question should be <strong>How do you\nprovide a modern user experience on the web?</strong>. Now were had something.\nSelling UX as a solution to companies was tangible. If we could market\nthat UX improvements was the way to solve common problems in modern web\napps then we could hook companies on the idea that Single Page Apps was\nthe best way to deliver modern UX. If we could convince companies on\nSPAs then we have the chance to convince them that Ember.js is the best\nframework for building out SPAs. At this point we have to make a case\nthat DockYard is the best company as building Ember.js applications. We\nnow had our marketing funnel. We plan on putting this funnel to the test\nin early 2015, but don&#39;t expect any significant number of qualified\nleads to be produced until late 2015, more likely early 2016.</p>\n\n<h3>Elixir</h3>\n\n<p>While we are not currently writing any <a href=\"http://elixir-lang.org\">Elixir</a> apps I think \nit will be part of our offerings around Q3 2015. Specifically because of\nthe <a href=\"http://www.phoenixframework.org/\">Phoenix Framework</a> being very\nsimilar to <a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org\">Ruby on Rails</a> I think we should be\nable to ramp upon it quickly.</p>\n\n<p>The other choices I considered looking into were\n<a href=\"http://golang.org\">Go</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a>. Elixir\nfeels like the best of the three to me. It is far less popular than the\nother two but considering it is backed by Erlang and boasts the most\napproachable syntax, has meta-programming, concurrency, and is built for\nfault tolerance I feel of those three language Elixir is the best suited\nfor the future. Of course, this is a gamble and time will tell.</p>\n\n<h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>\n\n<p>Our involvement with Ruby on Rails will never go away completely but I\ndon&#39;t see Ruby or Rails being a serious part of our technology identity\nin the future. I would like to think that we were out with a bang\nthough, in early 2014 we were selected to redesign\n<a href=\"http://rubygems.org\">RubyGems</a>. We launched the redesign at\n<a href=\"http://rubyconf.org\">RubyConf</a> and it was a nice way to say &quot;thank-you&quot;\nto a community that we&#39;ve benefited from for so long.</p>\n\n<h3>Heading into next year</h3>\n\n<p>I always want DockYard to be a company that does not stagnate on\ntechnology. I enjoy working with and exploring new technology and I\nalways want to push our engineering team to do that same. In the near\nfuture I think Ember.js and Elixir will be important for us, of course\nwe must be open-minded enough about new technology on the horizon.</p>\n\n<h2>Design</h2>\n\n<p>Design has become so essential to our process I don&#39;t understand how we\ngo by in the early years without a dedicated design team. We rely upon\ndesign to manage our Discovery Phase, build and inform our estimations.\nDesign has more impact on us converting a client out of Discovery to a\nfull client than engineering does.</p>\n\n<h3>UX East</h3>\n\n<p>This year we ran our first Design conference, <a href=\"http://uxeast.org/\">UX East</a>.\nIt was structured as a design camp with two talks and one workshop.  The conference was organized by our Creative Director Steven Trevathan\nand Maria Matveeva we believe we were hugely successful.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re already beginning plans for next year&#39;s UX East (you can sign up for\nupdates, including call for proposals, <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/_NCUL\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<h3>Team Structure</h3>\n\n<p>Every project is now assigned at least two designers. This is partially\nbecause the projects are big enough to merit the team, but it&#39;s also a huge\nqualitative add to the final delivery. Pairing designers is really helpful for &quot;leveling up&quot; as well. Matching\ndesigners by their different strengths they&#39;ll help each other grow. The\nconcept is very similar to pair programming, however the designers go\nthrough many rounds of critiques instead of using the same computer for an\nextended period.</p>\n\n<p>While we hadn&#39;t previously done this, and it looks like a fairly obvious\nimprovement to make, the result has been surprisingly positive and our most\nrecent projects are seeing a huge benefit from it.</p>\n\n<h3>Setting Goals &amp; Sticking To Them</h3>\n\n<p>One thing we&#39;re very good at is coming up with ideas. Lot&#39;s of them. There is\nno shortage there, however there is a real challenge in effectively using down\ntime and DockYard Fridays to commit to delivering on those ideas. I believe\nthis is due to not having specific departmental goals that directly fit into\ncompany annual or quarterly objectives.</p>\n\n<p>An example of this challenge is <a href=\"http://toolsofthetrade.dockyard.com/\">Tools of the Trade</a>.\nIn the beginning of 2014 we put effort into creating small and novel icon packs\nand distrubuting them as free to use. It generated some interest, and we had\nfun with our icons, but we dropped the ball and lost momentum on it. Not because\nwe didn&#39;t enjoy making them or that it didn&#39;t benefit our designers by the\nchallenge, but because it didn&#39;t fit cleanly into any company objective.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve set a Q1 2015 goal to create a program and agenda for design experimentation\nwith a focus on single page web applications. By that objective we&#39;ll be aiming\nto provide more practical design tools, design and interaction patterns, and free\nassets for other designers in creating single page web applications. By commiting\nto this goal and using Tools of the Trade as vehicle, we should be able to promote\nourselves, &quot;level up&quot; our designers, and effectively utilizing downtime.</p>\n\n<h2>Business</h2>\n\n<p>On the business side of things we&#39;ve begun to add more structure to DockYard. We hired a CEO coach \nto take us through an OGSM (Objectives, Goals, Strategies and Measures)\nplanning session for 2015. It was a tiring two days of time that helped\nus discover what type of company we want to be. The management team has\nall decided that DockYard should aim big and that is what we&#39;re going to\ndo.</p>\n\n<h3>Office Space</h3>\n\n<p>In Q2 2015 we&#39;ll be moving into a new office space. Our current space\nhas served us well but it has its problems. The new space will be\nmodern and have plenty of space for us (we&#39;re upgrading from 2,800 sq/ft to\n7,800 sq/ft). I&#39;m excited to share those plans in the upcoming months.</p>\n\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n\n<p>I hope this year&#39;s reflection has been useful for you in some way. Each\nyear&#39;s summary has felt different and I&#39;m sure next year&#39;s will too. As\na company DockYard has taken some knocks this year but we came out\nstronger for it with more focus and an actual gameplan. I&#39;d love to hear\nother&#39;s experiences as well in the comments.</p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["opinion","business"],"date":"2014-12-28T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/12/26/pattern-matching-in-elixir-for-rubyists","title":"Pattern Matching in Elixir for Rubyists","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>This is the first in a series of posts for helping Ruby devs understand\nsome of the concepts in Elixir.</p>\n\n<h2>Pattern Matching</h2>\n\n<p>Pattern Matching is one of my favorite Elixir features. Let&#39;s take a\nlook. (using an <a href=\"http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/7.html#7.2-maps\">Elixir\nMap</a>)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight elixir \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>%{foo: bar} = %{foo: &quot;baz&quot;}\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>The above is matching a pattern. Don&#39;t think of <code>=</code> as assignment, you\nshould think of <code>=</code> as <em>equality</em>. The left-hand side of the <code>=</code> is\nequal to the right-hand side. Through pattern matching the variable\n<code>bar</code> is assigned the value <code>&quot;baz&quot;</code>. Consider:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight elixir \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>[foo, bar] = [1, 2]\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p><code>foo</code> is assigned <code>1</code> and <code>bar</code> is assigned <code>2</code>. Patterns can match to\nany depth:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight elixir \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>[foo, bar, [baz]] = [1, 2, [3]]\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>here <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> have the same value from the previous example but\n<code>baz</code> is now assigned the value of <code>3</code>. Alternatively if we had written:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight elixir \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>[foo, bar, baz] = [1, 2, [3]]\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p><code>baz</code> is now assigned the value of <code>[3]</code>. This would be an example of a\nsemi-greedy matcher. You can expand upon this to greedily match the\nentire statement:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight elixir \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>my_list = [1, 2, [3]]\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now <code>my_list</code> greedily matched to the entire right-hand side of the\n<code>=</code>. So why is this cool? Let&#39;s take a look at a Ruby method that\nhas some conditions:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">foo</span>(a, b, c)\n  <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> a == <span class=\"symbol\">:something</span>\n    ...\n  <span class=\"keyword\">elsif</span> b == <span class=\"symbol\">:other</span>\n    ...\n  <span class=\"keyword\">else</span>\n    ...\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>The above is likely something familar to many Ruby devs. This presents\nsome problems. Any methods with several code paths increases the\ncomplexity of the method. Complex methods can be difficult to test in\nisolation. Let&#39;s take a look at how this would be implemented in Elixir:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight elixir \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>def foo(:something, b, c) do\n  ...\nend\n\ndef foo(a, :other, c) do\n  ...\nend\n\ndef foo(a, b, c) do\n  ...\nend\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>The first question Ruby devs have is <em>why are there three functions of the same\nname?</em> In Elixir you can define multiple functions of the same name as\nlong as the function signatures are unique. Functions are matched\nagainst the values passed in. So <code>foo(:something, 2, 3)</code> would match the\nfirst <code>foo</code> defined. <code>foo(1, :other, 3)</code> matches the second. <code>foo(1, 2,\n3)</code> matches the third. Match priority is the order in which the\nfunctions are defined.</p>\n\n<p>Now our functions are concise, and focused on the very specific\nbehavior. The conditional is obfuscated through the pattern matching but\nthis is a common design pattern in Elixir so it should be embraced.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern matching can be more complex:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight elixir \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>def foo(%{foo: bar}, &quot;baz&quot;) do\n  ...\nend\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>The above will match: <code>foo(%{foo: &quot;zeb&quot;}, &quot;baz&quot;)</code> but would not match\n<code>foo(%{foo: &quot;zeb&quot;}, &quot;bar&quot;)</code> because the second argument does not match.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/4.html\">Elixir Pattern Matching\nGuide</a> for more\ninformation.</p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["elixir","ruby"],"date":"2014-12-26T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/12/12/importance-of-process","title":"The Importance of Process, and Why It Matters","dockyarder":"paul-webb","body":"<p>I joined DockYard in April of this year, after leaving a small startup. Before that, I was at another\nstartup and doing lots of freelance/agency work. In all of these places, there was never an existing\nprocess in place, aside from what was in my head. For better or worse, this was fine and allowed me to\nget work done. What I have learned since joining DockYard however, is that my old method of working is\ndangerous for a bigger company and just does not work.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, I resisted changing my process, like a fool/jerk. Why should I? My process has worked for\nyears, it was inherently superior! <em>Obviously</em>, this was not true.

All of my wishes are about making my\napplications smaller. One of the constant complaints I see about Ember\nis that it is &quot;too fat&quot;. You may not know this but this problem is\nsolveable and can actually grow alongside Ember to ensure your assets\nare a slim as they can be. On to the wish list!</p>\n\n<h3>Tree Shaking</h3>\n\n<p>Are you familiar with Tree Shaking? The concept is simple, a dependency\ngraph of your application is built. Let&#39;s say one of your files requires\n<code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>. And <code>A</code> requires <code>D</code>, and <code>F</code>. And <code>C</code> required <code>F</code>.\nCurrently with Ember CLI all files for all of your dependencies will get\nincluded in the final build. So if there is an <code>E</code> file it will be in\nthe final build even if you are not using it in any way, this is wasteful.\nWith ES6 the dependency graph can be built between your files, any files\nthat are not in the graph are not included in the final built. They are\n&quot;shaken&quot; out of the build process. This means a smaller footprint for your assets.</p>\n\n<p>There are two major hurdles to implementing this in Ember CLI right now.\nThe first is that doing a static analysis on the dependency graph may\nresult in false positives of what files to ignore for the build. While\nthere are many files that you are depending upon via the <code>import</code>\nstatement:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"reserved\">import</span> { foo, bar } from <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">baz</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>;\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>This is very easy to parse. But your application can also import\nresources via the Ember Resolver:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>container.lookup(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">model:foo</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>);\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>A few levels down a <code>resolveOther</code> function is called and <code>lookup</code> is\nturned into a <code>require</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>require(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">my-app/models/foo</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>);\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>parsing this out is not as simple. We could just assume everything in\nthe app&#39;s namespace should be part of the final build, but when other\nlibraries are doing more complex tricks with importing this presents a\nproblem. For example, in the latest version of Ember Validations the\nvalidators themselves live in the <code>ember-validations</code> namespace. You can\noverride validators by placing them in your namespace. The lookup is\nsomething like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"function\">lookupValidator</span>(name) {\n  <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> container.lookup(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">validator:</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>+name) ||\n    container.lookup(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">ember-validations@validator:</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>+name);\n}\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>How do we properly parse this out to include the correct validators in\nthe dependency graph? One solution might be for library authors to\ndeclare which files should always be included in the final build, but\nthis defeats the purpose of only including what is being used. If the\napplication is using the Presence Validator but not the Inclusion\nValidator why would I want those extra LOCs?</p>\n\n<p>The other major hurdle is Ember itself. While Ember&#39;s source is in ES6\nform the final build that you get is in AMD. Which means it is one file.\nEmber will have to be distributed in the original ES6 form. I am also\nnot a fan of the current package names. If this ever happens I would\nmuch prefer:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"reserved\">import</span> Component from <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">ember/component</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>;\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>rather than</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"reserved\">import</span> Component from <span class=\"error\">`</span>ember-views/views/component<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">;\n</span></span></pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Separate builds</h3>\n\n<p>Ember CLI is all or nothing right now. Which means that you have a\nsingle build pipeline for your application assets (<code>app-name.js</code>) and a single build\npipeline for 3rd party assets (<code>vendor.js</code>). It would be nice to define\nadditional assets that can be built into final files. For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-admin/issues/32\">this\nrequest for Ember\nAdmin</a>. Technically\nthis could be done right now but it would require some heavy hacking of\nthe vendor asset pipeline in Ember CLI. Personally I would like to see\nan API for this specifically. Perhaps it could be in the form of isolating a namespace to\nbe ignored in the <code>vendor.js</code> final concat but still output in the\n<code>dist/</code> directory.</p>\n\n<h3>Async code loading</h3>\n\n<p>This wish dove-tails off the previous one. Now that we have our separate\nassets how do we safely load them into our Ember apps? If we are\nisolating the assets I would think this implies they aren&#39;t meant for\nconsumption at application launch. Going back to the Ember Admin\nexample, not all users need those LOCs. Only when an authorized user\nhits the admin functionality should it pull down the Ember Admin assets\nand plug into the app. This would be ideal. The major hurdle here is\nwith how the container currently works. Perhaps something like this\ncould put it on the right track:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"function\">resolveOther</span>: <span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(name) {\n  <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (needAsyncLoad(name)) {\n    asyncLoad(name).then(<span class=\"keyword\">function</span>() {\n      <span class=\"comment\">// after this load completes the name</span>\n      <span class=\"comment\">// would be removed from the list of</span>\n      <span class=\"comment\">// resources requiring async loading</span>\n      resolveOther(name);\n    }\n  } <span class=\"keyword\">else</span> {\n    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> require(name);\n  }\n}\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>This would allow even further shrinking of the initial applicaiton\nfootprint. Only include what is necessary, async load other assets. This\ncreates the illusion of speed which is just as good as actual speed. You\nwill have the trade-off of periodic sections of your app with a longer\nthan normal loading state, but that should only happen once per\napplication instance.</p>\n\n<h3>Wishes to reality</h3>\n\n<p>Fulfilling these wishes should go a long way to negating the &quot;too fat&quot; argument for\nEmber. Here&#39;s to hoping that 2015 will see a more lean Tomster.</p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ember","opinion"],"date":"2014-11-28T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/11/18/we-did-it","title":"UX East Camp 2014","dockyarder":"steven-trevathan","body":"<p><a href=\"http://uxeast.org/\" title=\"UX East Camp\">We did it.</a> This weekend went far better than we ever could have imagined.

It is kind of like a conference, except you also get the opportunity to work on your own project and get feedback from others while there. I am helping organize the event, and a large chunk of my time will be spent taking photos and helping with other random tasks, so I wanted to bring a project that\u2019s small and easy to manage.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/ux-east-sketches.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>My project is practicing how to quickly sketch ideas by hand.</p>\n\n<p>When I first started as a UX Designer at <a href=\"http://dockyard.com/\">DockYard</a>, I noticed how confident the other designers were at sketching. <a href=\"http://dockyard.com/team#logan-faerber\">Logan</a> just happens to be a <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/1765074-UX-East-Icons?list=users&amp;offset=3\">kickass illustrator</a>, which helps. But still, I felt like I lacked confidence in comparison. I\u2019ve been trying to improve, but had not tried anything focused on sketching specifically yet.</p>\n\n<h2>Why is sketching useful?</h2>\n\n<p>Sketching is a great tool not only to produce work deliverable to the client (hand drawn wireframes are often part of the Discovery phase in our work) but also a way to think more clearly. If I can articulate an idea through a drawing, I have a good understanding of it. In the process of drawing something out, I also find the fuzzy areas that need more definition, and I am able to ask better questions as a result.</p>\n\n<p>Writing on a subject is similar to this exploratory sketching. By trying to write on a subject, I find unexplained pieces, and am forced to form my thoughts clearly. But writing only uses one aspect of an idea. Visuals are something else. I want to rely on both verbal (writing) and visual (drawing) thinking in my work.</p>\n\n<h2>How to practice?</h2>\n\n<p>I decided to focus on practicing only the skill to express a single idea through a very simple drawing. As an art supply enthusiast, it is easy for me to get carried away in selecting just the right pen, paper or color for a project. To counter this, I limited my tools: a clipboard, a single medium-weight black marker, and a sizable stack of half-sheets of printer paper.</p>\n\n<p>I further limited possible distractions by deciding not to focus on high quality, thoughtful drawings, and instead produce many simple drawings. For this reason, I will also not look for great reference material, but try to just get the visual idea down on paper quickly instead.</p>\n\n<p>I will also focus on actually drawing, rather than annotating. In the few practice drawings I made so far I resorted to writing the details I could not get into the drawing. It would be great to get away from this.</p>\n\n<p>When I finish one of these simple drawings, I will slide it to the bottom of the stack so I\u2019m ready to start another one. I will not focus on judging the results too quickly.</p>\n\n<p>At camp, I might share the drawings I make, and ask for feedback on how to make them more clear. Will they make sense? With some practice, I hope that they do.</p>\n\n<p>So, here\u2019s what I am working on. Pretty simple, and should be fun! I also asked a couple of colleagues what they are planning to do\u200a\u2014\u200aand here it is:</p>\n\n<h2>What Steve is working on</h2>\n\n<p>He&#39;s going to work on a video game idea that originally started as a web-comic at DockYard. In addition to that he&#39;s taking a look at some various prototyping tools (as well exploring InVision a little deeper).</p>\n\n<h2>What  Tim is working on</h2>\n\n<p>Tim has been working on a typeface that is targeted to be both practical and highly legible.

It&#39;s just that I find it incredibly difficult to describe to\nothers in an &quot;elevator pitch&quot; what a software consultancy can offer\nwithout going down the &quot;technology&quot; rabbit hole.</p>\n\n<p>The exercise is: <em>if I were introduced to someone at a party, how do I convince them they should \nhire DockYard</em>? Funny enough, I can&#39;t do it. This is a very large\ndeficiency for me/my company right now. To date <strong>all</strong> of our\ncontracts have been from inbound sales. Which is great, but we need to\nbe able to sell our services to companies that don&#39;t yet know about us.</p>\n\n<p>So what does DockYard do? According to our current landing page <em>We\ncreate web &amp; mobile applications</em>. Which is 100% true, but if I told\nthis to you I doubt you&#39;d hire us. I asked other DockYard&#39;ers to try\ntheir hand at writing the DY pitch. To illustrate how difficult this is\nhere is what they came up with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>DockYard designs and develops applications for people who have an idea and don&#39;t know what to do next</em></li>\n<li><em>We build web products, and focus on quality.</em></li>\n<li><em>We create software that helps people. A client can come to us seeking advice regarding software development practices or looking to implement a product he/she has been thinking about. Our main focus is delivering a solution that a client is happy with by using powerful visual design, best software engineering practices and latest technologies.</em></li>\n<li><em>We&#39;re a design and development shop specializing in really intuitive, responsive user interfaces. We work primarily with Ember.js, which is a JavaScript framework similar to Angular and Backbone. On the backend, we prefer a Rails backend and transactional database, which is more reliable than the NoSQL databases out there.</em></li>\n<li><em>DockYard leads projects from ideas to user-friendly products that are built by cutting edge technologies and methodologies. As a team, we put clients&#39; business goals in the forefront through the collaborative expertise of our designers and developers.</em></li>\n<li><em>DockYard helps business owners create web apps with the combined power of Ember and great design.</em></li>\n<li><em>We&#39;re a team of software designers and engineers deeply invested in producing the best solution to a challenge, rather than just the one that works.</em></li>\n<li><em>We do a lot of research before we start designing, so our projects are thought through. Designers have a lot of say in what we actually build, compared to other shops, so it makes the work more meaningful.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some of these go beyond the scope of a &quot;pitch&quot; but I think the message is clear: this is not an easy assignment. \nThe common theme is the focus on our expertise, which is a good angle. Expertise has been what defines DockYard.\nBut do all companies care about <strong>how</strong> we build? </p>\n\n<p>Currently nearly all of our clients get in touch with us because\nof our expertise in Ember.js. At that point the sale is\nactually quite easy. There aren&#39;t a lot of consultancies right now\nclaiming expertise in Ember. Amongst those firms I believe that\nDockYard is considered one of the top. So by the time the client\ncontacts us they have probably already decided to go with us. This is\ngreat but it paints us into a niche. We&#39;re missing out on the other\n99.99% of the opportunities that don&#39;t know about us.</p>\n\n<p>So how do some other software consultancies pitch? I don&#39;t know if it is\nfair to use the marketing tagline from their website as their &quot;pitch&quot;\nbut I think it is close enough for the purposes of this article. Let&#39;s\ntake a look:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thoughtworks</strong> <em>We provide software delivery, pioneering tools and\nconsulting for organizations with ambitious missions.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Pivotal Labs</strong> <em>We transform how the world builds software.</em></li>\n<li><strong>thoughtbot</strong> <em>Our clients hire us to design and build their\nproducts. We focus on user outcomes and simplicity. We write code for\niOS, Android, and the web.</em></li>\n<li><strong>37signals</strong> <em>an elite team of expert web design and usability\nspecialists dedicated to simple, clear, and useable customer-focused\ndesign.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know if this really helps me or confuses me even more. These are\nall over the place, from general, to technology specific, to downright\nvague. Each of these companies have been very successful. How much of\ntheir success do they owe to their sales pitches? <strong>37signals</strong> (when\nthey were a consultancy) was famous for being a referral based business.\n(or at least advertising themselves as such) I don&#39;t know <strong>thoughtbot</strong>\nas well as I used to but I believe they still don&#39;t have any internal\nsales team. <strong>Thoughtworks</strong> and <strong>Pivotal</strong> both have sales/biz-dev\nteams. Their marketing lines are very vague, very &quot;wide-net&quot;. No help\nhere.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s sad to say but I am currently at a loss on how to effectively sell my own company. </p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["opinion","business","marketing"],"date":"2014-11-07T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/10/30/motivation-vs-discipline","title":"Motivation vs Discipline","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>We&#39;ve all seen the <strong>Motivational Posters</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/motivational-1.jpg\" alt=\"Motivate\"></p>\n\n<p>I always hear people talk about\n<strong>motivation</strong>. <em>What motivates you?</em> <em>I&#39;m lacking motivation.</em> Well I&#39;m\nhere to tell you that motivation is bullshit.</p>\n\n<p>Motivation may get you to take on a task or behavior that you don&#39;t\nnormally do but eventually that motivation will either not be there any\nmore or won&#39;t be effective.

Contributors can always refer to a styleguide to help them create new pages and elements. Careful attention to a styleguide can prevent a contributor from designing or developing components that don&#39;t conform to the designers&#39; vision.</p>\n\n<p>Most styleguides are created by designers and developers prior to development to guide the translation of comps into code. In a perfect world, that styleguide is a living document that is updated as changes are made to the design. This often doesn&#39;t happen. As changes are made throughout a project&#39;s development cycle, the styleguide is rarely updated. At some point on almost every project, that styleguide is no longer a reliable, authoritative document.</p>\n\n<p>If only there was a better way...</p>\n\n<h2>Enter KSS</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://warpspire.com/kss/\">KSS</a> is a methodology and set of tools that will help you create automated, living styleguides. Through the KSS menting syntax and the KSS parser, the guide can be updated automatically throughout the development cycle. All those little adjustments and decisions that happen in conversations outside your documented channels will be reflected in your KSS styleguide. In theory, the styleguide will show the most up-to-date styles. KSS styleguides also render element states like <code>:hover</code> as you can see in this <a href=\"https://github.com/styleguide/css/\">example from GitHub</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/github-styleguide.jpg\" alt=\"GitHub Styleguide\"></p>\n\n<p>A KSS styleguide can be designed to reflect the look and layout of your project using existing styles:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/kss-styleguide-examples.jpg\" alt=\"Two KSS Styleguides\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>KSS isn&#39;t magic. It&#39;s not going to create the styleguide for you.</strong> You still have to do a lot of custom configuration and coding. Coding the styleguide starts with commenting your CSS. You have been leaving helpful comments for future developers all along, right?

It&#39;s a lot of up-front work, but there are examples and parsers already written for Node.js, Ruby, PHP, Sinatra, Rails, and so on.</p>\n\n<h2>Why use KSS?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>If standards, methodolgies, and tools are your thing, you&#39;ll like KSS:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The kss.js script can render elements with different states (called modifiers by KSS) directly in the styleguide blocks. For example, buttons with <code>:hover</code>, <code>:focus</code>, <code>:active</code>, states or even modifier classes like <code>.red</code>, <code>.is-active</code>, or <code>.disabled</code> will be automatically added to the styleguide allowing readers to see every possible state at once.</p></li>\n<li><p>CSS comments and styleguide documentation are bound together in the stylesheets, not some other styleguide-specific template. UX developers can comment the stylesheets they work in most while they&#39;re working in them.</p></li>\n<li><p>The styleguide templates can also include markup codeblocks, allowing readers to see the markup elements necessary to generate a component.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Why not use KSS?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>If you&#39;re in the &quot;tools are bullshit&quot; crowd, you&#39;re going to hate KSS:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Styleguides created with KSS are only as reliable as the CSS and markup used to generate them. If an element is changed in a way that no longer conforms to the design comps, the styleguide will no longer reflect the correct way that element is supposed to be styled. For example, a developer might change the border radius of a particular button for a new page and doesn&#39;t realize that he or she has just changed the base button style in the styleguide. Now the button entry styleguide is no longer a reliable representation of the styles established in the design comps.</p></li>\n<li><p>When elements are taken out of their context it can change how styles are applied. Elements have to be adjusted and changed just to appear correctly in the styleguide. This is work beyond what is strictly required to develop a site.</p></li>\n<li><p>Styleguide-only styles and markup might be confusing to developers joining a project. The rules and markup in the styleguide aren&#39;t necessarily the same rules or markup used in the site. When creating new elements that follow from a styleguide entry, simply copying the elements as they appear styleguide could cause layout and style problems.</p></li>\n<li><p>The KSS documention is spread out over many files. Nothing is centralized. Simply restructuring the styleguide, editing sections, or even adding new items requires sifting through many CSS files and templates. And when styles for elements are duplicated or spread across several pages, where do we put the documentation?</p></li>\n<li><p>Deciding what goes in the styleguide and how it is documented becomes another tangle of challenging questions. How do we describe this element? How to we organize the guide? What do we include?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>KSS Is Just Another Thing</h2>\n\n<p>The strength of KSS \u2013 automation \u2013 is also the source of its weakness \u2013 mutable elements. If the styleguide can be updated automatically, it can also be sabotaged accidentally. The styleguide must be QA&#39;ed alongside the site to ensure that it conforms to the design comps and that it accurately illustrates elements as they appear in the actual site pages. Developers must take care to pay attention to styleguide-only rules and markup.</p>\n\n<p>You could generate a static styleguide in your comping tool of choice as a definitive reference against which to check the living styleguide. But then you&#39;re just creating more documents that must be updated. You haven&#39;t solved the original problem.</p>\n\n<p>Implementing KSS requires additional UX Development and Design resources (additional QA, more templates, styleguide-only styles, controllers, etc.), but may save resources spent creating and updating a static styleguide.</p>\n\n<p>KSS is not a perfect solution to the problem of maintaining living styleguides. You&#39;ll simply have to try it in your workflow to evaluate its utility.</p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["tools","process","web-development"],"date":"2014-10-24T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/09/24/announcing-ux-east-camp","title":"Go: UX East's UX Camp","dockyarder":"steven-trevathan","body":"<p>We are pleased to announce <a href=\"http://uxeast.org/\">UX East&#39;s UX Camp</a>, a weekend of creative thinking, collaboration, and design in one big house on Nov 14\u201416th in <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/JPqdT\">Bryant Pond, ME</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t a typical networking event or conference.

There&#39;s a lot of information out there on what\nbrowsers do with JavaScript code in order to execute it faster. Let&#39;s go over some of the tips that\nwill help you write faster JavaScript code.</p>\n\n<h2>Tooling</h2>\n\n<p>There&#39;re are couple of tools that you can use to identify and fix peformance problems. One of the\nthem is Chrome Developer Tools (open Chrome Developer Tools, switch to <code>Profiles</code> tab and click <code>Start</code>).\nDeveloper Tools will give you a great overview of what actual happens in your application under the hood\n(what functions are called, how much CPU time they consumed, how much memory).

These posts aim to provide our current and prospective clients insight into how we approach development at DockYard.</p>\n\n<p>Building &quot;Quality&quot; software does not happen by accident. It is actually one of the unspoken sides of the \u201ciron triangle\u201d of project constraints (Scope, Cost, Time) - or should we call it a diamond now? Let\u2019s not go there! </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DEWme3R.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n\n<p>When making an investment in development of an application, the level of desired quality influences project cost and schedule.  Building an appropriate Quality Plan for a project requires time, planning and execution which is the responsibility of DockYard and the clients with whom we engage.  Below I layout the primary types of quality related practices we may consider applying to our (your) projects; always driven by clients\u2019 unique context (See my earlier blog post about context driving practices - <a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/06/06/process-paradox.html\">Process Paradox</a>).  This article does not serve to describe these quality practices in depth but will cover the basics in terms of how they could apply to client projects.  Any one of these practices in isolation is not an effective recipe for quality, it is the degree to which these practices are commingled in a logical way that results in positive outcomes. </p>\n\n<h2>Practice #1 - Test-Driven Development / Automated Testing</h2>\n\n<p>Before the Engineer writes a line of code they are investing time in thinking about and writing the appropriate test cases for the code - these tests will serve as a functional quality benchmark which the engineer can code towards. In parallel these efforts build up a library of automated tests that will ensure that the \u201cworking\u201d features built early in the project continue to work when new features (code) are introduced later on.  If we don\u2019t have these tests and we have 1000\u2019s of lines of code, testing/debugging overhead raises exponentially which will result in increased risk to project cost and/or desired schedule.  It\u2019s also important to note that this practice is functionally-centric and not visual which is addressed with other practices described below.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>What this means to the client</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>The cost and eventual savings related to this practice manifest themselves as time spent thinking vs. coding vs. testing. When we estimate what it will take to develop a given feature, we consider the time spent thinking about these tests, writing the tests, maintaining the tests in addition to writing the feature code.  However, keep in mind that the time spent testing later on in the project, when the code base has grown exponentially, is reduced due to this upfront investment of time (see figure below) because we have a growing set of automated tests that will ensure we continue to maintain high quality throughout the development cycle.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/2HBq9ie.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n\n<h2>Practice #2 - Pair Programing / Code Reviews</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes (usually) two heads are better than one.  Pair Programming is exactly as it is described. Two engineers team up to work side by side on a single unit of code (or feature.) In a 2013 article published by the Economist a study conducted by Laurie Williams of the University of Utah showed \u201c<em>...paired programmers are 15% slower than two independent individual programmers, while &quot;error-free&quot; code increased from 70% to 85%. Since testing and debugging are often many times more costly than initial programming, this is an impressive result. Pairs typically consider more design alternatives than programmers working alone, and arrive at simpler, more maintainable designs; they also catch design defects early.</em>\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Code Reviews by a peer or more senior engineer serve to ensure that the code being written meets agreed best practices and that mistakes of the past don\u2019t get reintroduced. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>What this means to the client</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Pair programing and Code Reviews are practices DockYard believes yield higher quality code while also establishing a continuous learning culture across our engineering team.  The extent to which we apply these practices is less variable in that it is part of our company DNA - however, like any practice, a client\u2019s project context will dictate the extent to which these apply.  The client will incur the benefit of a well rounded and productive engineering team which can translate to reduced project cost.</p>\n\n<h2>Practice #3 - Manual Testing</h2>\n\n<p>In a literal sense this is the type of testing conducted by a human who seeks to ensure the less common use cases which may not have been exercised by an Automated Test or code review are working as expected. Additionally, this type of testing ensures the visual design of the product has been upheld -  Spacing, pixels, colors, fonts, etc.  Browser compatibility is also something manual testing will verify. This type of testing is usually conducted by members of the project team and the client. They work in collaboration across the feature set, report and classify severity of bugs which are eventually assigned to engineers when appropriate.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>What this means to the client</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>The client should be prepared to be a very active participant in this practice and schedule their time accordingly.  Feature complexity will drive the amount of time required for this type of testing - which might be nil if complexity is low.  A very rich user experience will require more testing and thus manifest itself in terms of increased time/cost.  </p>\n\n<h2>Practice #4 - Client Demos (and Acceptance Testing)</h2>\n\n<p>For most projects we work in 1-2 week iterations (sprints) and at the conclusion of this time period we typically demonstrate the progress we have made by sharing working software. These demonstrations serve a dual purpose:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>gives the client opportunity to verify development is proceeding in the desired direction, and if not, attempt to course correct early on vs. late in the project when course correction can be very costly</li>\n<li>allows the team to reflect and continuously improve how they are executing the project.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When a feature is ready for prime time, we will usually ask the client to formally accept the feature as complete.  This ensures the team can shift their full focus and attention to building the next features on the backlog. Context switching can be very costly in terms of productivity, therefore we try to call things \u201cDone Done\u201d before moving on. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>What this means to the client</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Similar to manual testing, client should be prepared to be a very active participant in both demos and conducting acceptance testing within agreed timeframes.  Deviation from established timeframes will result in increased project cost/time.  Therefore, whenever we engage with a client, we request upfront a high level of collaboration and availability to keep things moving along.  </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully after reading this article, you have gained an appreciation for some of the considerations we make in terms building quality into our projects.  The level of quality a client desires and the pride DockYard has in its deliverables drives the extent to which these practices are utilized.  Therefore, if you are interested in engaging with us, think about the level of quality you expect and we will work together to derive an appropriate quality plan that balances your cost and time constraints.</p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["quality","engineering","planning","process","client","project-management"],"date":"2014-09-19T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/09/12/features-as-business-objectives","title":"Reducing Project Costs: Features As Business Objectives","dockyarder":"michael-dupuis","body":"<p>There is a lot of insight a developer can offer when it comes to reducing costs associated with building web applications. While few developers have MBA degrees, we are \u201cin the trenches\u201d when it comes to bringing a project from <a href=\"http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ideation_(idea_generation)\">ideation</a> to completion. We see where projects go astray and where in the process complexity gets introduced, timelines get pushed out, and costs rise.</p>\n\n<p>Failed features are a significant cost to any project. I\u2019m defining a failed feature as a feature which gets implemented by the developer correctly, but which was ill-conceived in the planning stages. There\u2019s no 404 error pages, just poor user experiences that don\u2019t serve the application\u2019s aim.</p>\n\n<p>To mitigate failed features, there is a first principle that I think clients should apply at the outset of any software project: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Align the application\u2019s features with business goals.</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u201cHave attainable goals,\u201d is something you hear in a range of industries \u2013 from fitness to financial planning. For example, it is common when designing an investment portfolio to come up with a baseline for what you\u2019d like to have saved by the time you retire. Goals help quantify short-term success (meeting monthly savings goals) and bring context to immediate financial decisions (going on an extravagant vacation vs contributing to the 401k).</p>\n\n<p>In many regards, defining business goals is far harder than designing a feature for an application. Developers can implement an idea, but if the idea is not well grounded or refined enough, the implementation does not matter. Application consumers will not be able to use the feature in a way that translates to success for the business. For all intents and purposes, the feature is \u201cbroken\u201d and costs are about to go up because it will need to be fixed.</p>\n\n<p>This is why coming to a consultancy with a list of features is problematic. Features are not grounded in any sort of reasoning; business objectives are. Enter the planning process with a set of business objectives for the application.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a simple case. A client is overhauling their marketing site. They sit down in their first planning meeting with the designers and developers and say \u201cwe want a blog.\u201d A blog is a feature \u2013 it is not a business objective. What would be more helpful from the designer and developers\u2019 perspectives is to hear: \u201cwe want a way to show prospective clients that our firm is transparent.\u201d This a business objective. It informs the designer that there is a target audience to design for (prospective clients). It tells the designer a little bit about the client\u2019s values (transparency). Yes, it may lead to a blog, but what\u2019s important is that it grounds the feature with a purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Features must align with business goals, because they create the theoretical framework in which the application operates; the alternative is an aimless application with a lot of code, a lot of options, and a lot of usability problems. Designing a user experience which gets the consumer from point A to point B becomes difficult because there is not a logical consistency to the elements in the application. Features do not have a unique roles, and so the designer cannot delegate responsibility in a predictable manner.</p>\n\n<p>Features that are not aligned with business objectives are expensive.</p>\n\n<p>It goes without saying, but clear design thinking translates into cleaner implementations for the developers building the application. Features can be added, removed, and enhanced without hurting other elements of the application. Code becomes less coupled, is more maintainable, and can be better tested.</p>\n\n<p>Features without well-defined roles don\u2019t have a place in the application\u2019s ecosystem, and so they often fail. This is a worst case scenario. It means that users can\u2019t interact with the application in a way that\u2019s meaningful for the business. And since these failed features need to be fixed and re-worked to meet the business objective (which should have been known and communicated at the outset of the project \u201cdiscovery\u201d process), the client has expended the following resources:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the time that went into designing and implementing the failed feature</li>\n<li>the cost that went into designing and implementing the failed feature</li>\n<li>the time that will go into designing and implementing the correct feature</li>\n<li>the cost that will go into designing and implementing the correct feature</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is to say nothing of the opportunity costs. While one client is figuring all of this out, a competitor who aligned their features with their business objectives and \u201cgot it right\u201d on the first attempt is gaining happy, new users. </p>\n\n<p>When a businesses hires a software consultancy to develop an application, they\u2019re bringing in skills and expertise from the outside. It\u2019s unlikely that a developer is going to advise a client on how to gain market share, and it\u2019s just as unlikely that a client is going to open a designer/developer\u2019s eyes to a new application feature. Rather than planning an application around a set of features, clients can make the most of a consultancy&#39;s resources by coming to the planning stages of a project with well-defined business objectives.</p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design-process","business","design-thinking","engineering","planning","process"],"date":"2014-09-12T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/09/11/fear-of-failure","title":"The Fear of Failure","dockyarder":"logan-faerber","body":"<p>When confronted with a new task it&#39;s natural for someone to feel a sense of anxious hesitation. Sure, it varies between individuals depending on the activity or setting, but entering an unfamiliar scenario can make anyone feel uncomfortable. Often this anxiety leads someone to succumb to their fears of failure, which ultimately results in them not even taking a chance at learning something new.</p>\n\n<p>No one wants to be a failure - there&#39;s a connotation that you should just give up or else be publicly humiliated. Thanks to the recent development of social networks, anyone can declare someone as a failure simply by leaving a comment on a video online or posting blanketed statements on various articles - all the while never having to say it to their face directly or give useful constructive feedback. This mentality comes from a very judgmental and one sided declaration that spurs from people&#39;s fear of being a failure themselves. </p>\n\n<p>Alone, the term failure is a simple solution to a more complex problem. It&#39;s quick to label the scenario as everything having gone wrong rather than taking the time necessary to provide constructive feedback or to consider steps leading up to the &quot;failure&quot;. By neglecting to reflect on the the particulars of the situation we are not learning from our mis-steps. </p>\n\n<p>Rather than refer to these results as failures, I like to think of them as mistakes, granting more leniency to a lifetime of self-educating. While a failure feels conclusive, a mistake feels like a small part of a whole, which is more representative of how learning a new skill or concept should be. We should always be approaching the chance to learn something new with an optimistic and open mind, and the only way to do that successfully is to embrace the fact that you&#39;re bound to make mistakes along the way. Think about it; if a kid messes up, we don&#39;t instantly jump to calling them a failure. We let them know that it&#39;s okay, they&#39;ve made a mistake, but then we follow up with an instruction or demonstration on how they could improve next time. This ability to showcase compassion when sharing ideas is how we&#39;ve come so far as a human race. We tend to be most curious as children because we&#39;re unaware of the cultural judgment that comes from not being right all the time. We&#39;re still willing to experiment without that fear of failure. The curiosity to learn something new is an exciting one, where we focus on ourselves improving and not the jealousy of what others have accomplished, so why not treat our entire lifetime of learning with a similar level of patience and understanding? </p>\n\n<p>Fear can be incredibly influential when learning something new as long as it&#39;s used to fuel the fire and not extinguish it - prove it wrong. Instead of focusing on what you have to accomplish and getting overwhelmed, take time to learn at your own pace; as they say, patience is a virtue. The best way to learn is to dive right in without thinking too heavily. By getting directly involved you will be learning through a hands on experience, which helps to reconfirm what works and what doesn&#39;t. As with most things, repetition is key to retaining information.  If you&#39;re willing to make mistakes along the way, jump right in and get your hands dirty. Not only will you avoid wasting time hesitating, but you&#39;re forced to find a solution now that you&#39;ve already begun. The less you think in these scenarios, the better. </p>\n\n<p>In order to learn we must be willing to make mistakes. Hundreds if not thousands of them. You&#39;ll probably even make some incredible, irreversible messes along the way. But rather than wasting time to criticize yourself or worry about what others think of you, focus on the task at hand. Take time to acknowledge what wasn&#39;t working, why it wasn&#39;t working, and move on. It&#39;s as simple as that. Ultimately our biggest failures lead to our greatest successes. So in order for us to improve and grow as individuals as well as a society we must try to overcome this fear or else we&#39;ll never progress, and that&#39;s the real failure.</p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["art","design","design-thinking","inspiration","design-process"],"date":"2014-09-11T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/08/25/design-and-big-data","title":"Comics and Big Data","dockyarder":"ashley-treni","body":"<p>I\u2019ve never been into comics or graphic novels.

I jotted down notes and took away a comprehensive understanding of design implications - keep colors relative and consistent, scale, got it, check.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/artdesign/people/dietmar-offenhuber/\">Dietmar</a>, my professor, had mentioned a book by Scott McCloud, <a href=\"http://scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/\">Understanding Comics</a>, and suggested looking to comics and film as an important metaphor for data visualization. Though I didn\u2019t pay much attention at the time, this notion stuck with me, and a few weeks ago I invested in that very book.</p>\n\n<p>Comics are a brilliant demonstration of visualizations that show multivariate information. Interactions, emotions, time, and space are all present, concurrent, and in flux - using frames and transitions to move the reader from one thought to the next. Comics pay attention to the readability of a story, by piecing together &quot;juxtaposed images in deliberate sequence.&quot; (McCloud, <em>Understanding Comics</em>) Unlike film, however, the static nature of comics leaves room for creative challenges balancing those variables simultaneously, especially the evolution of time. </p>\n\n<p>A series of information graphics is subject to the same dimensional considerations. Data Visualization is a balance of data analytics, visual representations, and a narration which provides a context for each investigation. Designing complex data to be comprehensive, interactive, and inviting is quite a challenge. While there are tools we can use to inspire visualization methods and techniques, there is much more to consider. There is an entire science behind visual cognition; why humans respond to certain characteristics faster than others (to be elaborated on at another point in time).</p>\n\n<p>To incorporate storytelling into data visualization is to consider who we design for. Like comics, we must create an environment for the audience to become immersed, and the presentation of ideas shapes the interaction. The visual language we use, the way we sequence through visualizations, directly influences the legibility of the information. When we embrace the humanism of comprehension and perception, we design the experience to promote the success of the reader&#39;s ability to understand.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s design to agitate curiosity and engagement. How can we utilize visual storytelling to inspire research, critical analysis, and conversation? Harnessing the power of design, we can draw inspiration from comics, and present information in a way that considers how the mind observes and acquires ideas.</p>\n\n<p>As it were, I\u2019m now devouring comics - making up for lost time. I\u2019ve put my summer reading list on hold - to make time for books shared with me from fellow designers at DockYard, who maybe not so surprisingly, already have a deep appreciation and love for the brilliant medium that is comics.</p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design","storytelling","information-graphics"],"date":"2014-08-25T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/08/22/design-an-experience","title":"Designing an Experience","dockyarder":"tim-walsh","body":"<p>Over the years I have attended a lot of concerts, probably too many to count.

Early on it was tools like Excel, MS Project, IBM Rational. Later it was Jira, Kanban Boards, GitHub Issue Visualization Tools and physical PostIt Note boards. I would classify the former tools being more aligned with senior management&#39;s desire to be \u201cWell Informed\u201d and the latter being more team centric and aligned with Iterative software development. </p>\n\n<p>Working with both distributed and co-located teams has challenged me to devise appropriate work tracking strategies for these very different team contexts.  However, one thing has remained the same to this day: I have never worked with a team that has determined they do not want to do any level of work tracking either in a high or low fidelity way regardless of the software development methodology being applied.</p>\n\n<p>For purposes of this article I will be discussing some of the benefits we have seen in using a physical board with a couple of our co-located DockYard project teams. While I do maintain an appreciation of the big picture plan (aka High-Level Plan),  I have come to embrace a concept that is advocated in the field of Exercise Science - something I have been reading up on lately. I am sure this is not the only field of study citing this approach but wanted to mention this one as top of mind. It is the notion of setting smaller objectives to take one (us) closer to a larger goal. In terms of software development a goal would be synonymous with a product feature. By no means is this a new frontier in development planning, it is simply an application of some already acknowledged concepts.  What I believe is the slight twist is the setting of \u201cDaily\u201d objectives  in addition to full Iteration objectives. Consider this Project Carpe Diem!</p>\n\n<p>At DockYard we are calling this approach \u201cGame-Plan.\u201d It covers the following four dimensions -</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Features</li>\n<li>Time (Days)</li>\n<li>Tasks (Hrs)</li>\n<li>Role on Team<br></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At DockYard we harnesses the power of the daily standup meeting with low tech multi-colored Post-It Notes on a physical board in the office.  During Iteration planning we discuss the next prioritized feature(s), lay out the relevant sub-features in agreeable sequence, define tasks for those sub-features across all the practice areas on our team. We set an estimation guardrail to have tasks be no smaller than half day\u2019s work and no larger than 2 - 3 days.  We discuss dependencies, hand offs, opportunities to parallelize (Optimize) work across different team members.  We start our iteration and reference the following board where we set/track daily team objectives - </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hwZuLsa.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n\n<p>At the conclusion of Iteration planning we take these tasks and convert them into GitHub issues aligned with a Milestone (Feature).

They&#39;re upset that they don&#39;t have the tools to create the caliber of experience others are building and it&#39;s all because a few people aren&#39;t buying into their process. You might have heard it or said it yourself that those in the way &quot;just don&#39;t get UX&quot;. I know I&#39;ve said it.</p>\n\n<p>From this point of view, we appear to be looking at the problem as a matter of conversion; turning someone who isn&#39;t interested in change of process into someone who&#39;ll embrace it. It&#39;s a hard sell and, if you&#39;ve ever experienced being hung up on while cold calling someone, you&#39;ll know that your chances of failure are much greater than your chance of conversion. But don&#39;t let that scare you.</p>\n\n<p>Just like the design process itself, there are many ways to approach this problem. Success in your approach is a matter of understanding perspective and - dare I say - empathy for those in the critical path.</p>\n\n<h2>Definitions</h2>\n\n<p>We all have a habit of creating definitions in our minds of what other people do from what we hear around the office (or internet) and they&#39;re often pretty far off base. Those definitions become our foundation for what it means to be those other things: a designer, a developer, a product manager, a CEO. Those definitions, baseless or not, are used to judge the value of the things we do.</p>\n\n<p>An example might be that most people realize they need a software developer to build an application but they may not understand the angles to be considered, the processes for discovering those angles, or the costs involved. It&#39;s easily misunderstood and can be a surprise for those outside of your industry.</p>\n\n<h2>Shared Values</h2>\n\n<p>We intend to create a great product and we understand there are many variations in process that could bring it to life. As creators, that process can often be poorly preconceived and unnecessarily limited before we get a hand in it. We have a few options from here to deliver our full value, and selling isn&#39;t one of them.</p>\n\n<p>Aaron Scott from <a href=\"http://leap.agency/\">Leap</a> gave a talk at <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/uxboston/events/136304392/\">UX Boston Conf</a> about doing your best in getting to know those you&#39;re working with to help deliver a winning concept to the client. This approach holds true in more ways than just reaching a final design; it will help you gain the buy-in you need to perform at your full potential.</p>\n\n<p>The stakeholder may understand what you do, need some experience of your process before understanding, or maybe they&#39;re not ready for it all. You need to know that they&#39;re acting off of their definitions, and it&#39;s not always their fault for having an incomplete picture. Just the same, it is equally important for us to understand them and their needs.</p>\n\n<p>If they&#39;re not ready, convincing them otherwise will cause anxiety during the project and potentially cause issues of trust with you or future designers if things don&#39;t go well. Use your best judgment and tread lightly.</p>\n\n<h2>Collaboration</h2>\n\n<p>When your work is primarily visual it can be especially difficult to get the buy in you need. Most of the stakeholders will have had vision for their entire lives and trust themselves to judge what they feel is good and bad. They have their own tastes, their own definitions of what you do, and their own expectations of the process.</p>\n\n<p>Our value as designers is best understood when demonstrated and this is your most powerful tool to gain buy in. Make room for them to be part of your design conversation. Problem solve and communicate with them like you might your design team. Let them breath the same air you are and replace your salesmanship with collaboration. Use this method instead of presentations and cold hard salesmanship or politics.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t believe they&#39;re a good fit to collaborate with your design team, you may wish to pass on their project. Consider them a &quot;client in training&quot;, give them your best advice, and set them free. Of course this isn&#39;t as easy when working in-house, where I would hope that if you&#39;ve come to this conclusion you&#39;d start looking for a more collaborative environment.</p>\n\n<p>So stop <em>selling</em> UX. Look around, listen, ask questions, and help the client in training see further before you put a contract in front of them. Your process of gaining an understanding of the product, users, and their context will sell your expertise all on its own. If they&#39;re not ready, which is up to you to decide, set them free.</p>\n\n<p>They may not always be a returning client, but they will respect you for being honest with them every step of the way - and that&#39;s a lifelong trust.</p>\n","summary":"Getting what you want out of your design process.","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design","design-process","design-thinking"],"date":"2014-07-25T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/07/23/repeat-patterns","title":"Making better repeat patterns","dockyarder":"maria-matveeva","body":"<p>I enjoy the look of hand-drawn things. And I use patterns a lot. But when the two are combined, the results are often disappointing. My least favorite thing is to see a pattern where identical copies of a hand drawn object were repeated without variation. The automatic repetition here is not appropriate to the shaky handmade look of the art.</p>\n\n<p>The effect reminds me of Office circa 1995 (remember the classic marble and granite patterns?) or the obviously tiled walls in video game environments. In a 3D environment, a small size of the tile that causes this obvious tiled look is a necessity to conserve processing power.</p>\n\n<p>Remember these?\n<img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/001-bad-textures.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Because I want to use hand drawn repeat patterns in my work, and it would be impractical to draw a thousand individual pieces to create the pattern, I experimented to determine exactly how many pieces I need to preserve the varied look, while being able to tile.</p>\n\n<p>When I intentionally draw similar objects, I found that 15-30 copies will make a decent repeat pattern. I draw more than I need, then squint and get rid of a few that are too dissimilar. Once pieces are arranged on the pattern, there will always be a few that stick out and attract attention to the \u201cseams\u201d between your pattern tiles. To solve this, I leave only a small amount of variation in both shape and placement, and I repeat a few of the shapes several times in a single tile. This distracts from the \u201cedges\u201d of the tiles because repetition happens on two different rhythms.</p>\n\n<p>Pattern element 2 is repeated several times within one unit.\n<img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/002-repeat-pieces.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Trying to get as far away as I can from the obvious square tiled look, I also experimented with other manners of tiling.

It outlines the ethical problems in running an experiment on unwilling participants, and how the scandal that followed damages the reputation of scientific research, which has ethical (not just legal) restrictions. It also reminds us that testing different versions of a product on users is nothing new, and we all seem OK with it as long as it stays in the realm of marketing.</p>\n\n<p>The outrage over users&#39; emotions being manipulated without consent reminds me of my own feeling of insecurity a few years ago, when personalized ads just started appearing on Facebook (somewhere around 2009?). Suddenly this free service, which I use for talking to friends, is listening in and pushing ads on me. Weird. I wanted to push them back.</p>\n\n<p>Can I do anything to these algorithms that determine what ads I see? I wanted to experiment with them - to manipulate the ads by intentionally changing my information and posting fake content from my profile. I didn&#39;t keep any screenshots for evidence, so you&#39;ll just have to believe that some of it worked well.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, I had to use Facebook at work quite a lot. As &quot;the web design person&quot; for a nonprofit organization, I posted to Facebook regularly and kept track of potentially abusive comments on the official page, so I had to be logged in and therefore exposed to the ads at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a female - especially a female of an important purchasing age like me - you&#39;ll have many companies fighting for your attention. In your early 20s it&#39;s mostly personal purchases like shoes, clothes and makeup. A few years later, you qualify into the coveted &quot;homemaker&quot; target market. You supposedly start making decisions for a growing family about which groceries, appliances and brand of house paint to get - and companies really want your attention.</p>\n\n<p>I was getting tired of the keywords and browsing history from my personal life following me around at work with supposedly relevant shopping ads, so I tried to confuse Facebook. </p>\n\n<p>First I tried posting fake announcements of a tropical vacation and labeling some of my photos with far-away locations, but the ads didn&#39;t change much. I would see the occasional 50% off ad for brand name luggage, but nothing drastic. Many of my Facebook friends were confused, including a few coworkers. (&quot;A three week vacation? What about my report?&quot;)</p>\n\n<p>Next, I changed my gender to male. I loved the ads that I got in return. Suddenly there were no glitter shoes, no 75% off designer dresses, no engagement rings. Instead I saw &quot;finish your computer science degree&quot;, high quality leather goods, and website hosting ads. I had not changed anything else about my behavior. The same keywords and likes give a girl and a boy version of me a completely different market persona. I enjoyed the boy version a lot more.</p>\n\n<p>The third thing I changed was location. Facebook seemed to save different location privacy settings on desktop and in the browser, and defaulted back to showing my location once in a while. I was not happy to reveal my exact location with each post. It just seemed too invasive. On top of that, Facebook started mining my friends&#39; location settings to determine mine whether I wanted to reveal it or not. It seemed easier to claim a false location than to keep fighting for it to remain blank. I set my hometown and current location to North Pole, Alaska.</p>\n\n<p>The ads felt a bit more brawny on top of my previous change to &quot;male&quot;. Some offers of rugged hiking boots (I actually buy hiking boots!) and tactical something or other. On the downside, one real life friend later said she was confused by the  North Pole location.</p>\n\n<p>Since I tried those interventions, Facebook algorithms have of course advanced, and the simple gender setting change today might not produce a significant change in ads. But it felt rewarding to kick back at the marketing machine, and to sometimes get results. I am a web designer, so I have to be a user of web things as well as a maker. I do not think I will be quitting Facebook this week, or next. But I enjoy running experiments back on it.</p>\n\n<p>As a user, I was able to influence my ads. As a designer, I remain skeptical of user declared content. For example, if I had access to the kind of data Facebook has on most users, and wanted to target a person of a specific age and gender, I would consider their behavior instead of relying on one setting. I would look to confirm their gender, relationship status and age settings with specific keywords or themes in their posts and things they reacted to. </p>\n\n<p>We should make sure our products do not break in &quot;weird&quot; cases (for example, when user settings and behavior seemingly contradict each other), and remain aware of the assumptions we make in the design process.</p>\n","summary":"How I tried to experiment back on Facebook.","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["experiments","advertising"],"date":"2014-07-18T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/07/18/design-as-conversation","title":"Design as Conversation","dockyarder":"ashley-treni","body":"<p>Our understanding of design is perpetually in flux.

The space of design expands to encapsulate all these areas, while simultaneously formalizing specialized methodologies.</p>\n\n<p>Design is a process; it no longer refers only to static artifacts or visualizations. Design is a craft as much as it is a way of thinking and interacting.</p>\n\n<p>At DockYard, the design and development teams work closely together in an open dialogue, problem solving and giving real time feedback. Functionality and usability are built to work with one another, and it is this exchange of ideas, the conversation, that allows for the success of this interdisciplinary collaboration. There is no hierarchy of thought; each person brings personal experience and skill that contributes to a richer shared understanding. Many in the design world have begun to formalize this process - identifying these as environments for \u201cinnovation\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>The success of design, however, doesn\u2019t lie in the adherence of these systems. As much as we may reflect on the process of design - it remains a real time activity. Visual design, UI/UX considerations, and software engineering are all skills that come second to the ability for a team to work together. Through conversation, articulation, and modeling, we design the way in which we confront social complexities and wicked problems that exist as a result of differing perspectives.

These fears exist in work environments, classrooms, within relationships - we so often are made to feel inadequate if our understanding doesn&#39;t match another&#39;s (or our own) expectations.</p>\n\n<p>The collaborative nature of design reacts against these pressures.

During application development we have frequently wished for a silver bullet for the sharing of concepts/code from one project to another.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli\">Ember CLI</a> has given us the opportunity to set the conventions for sharing that we have been searching for.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few weeks we have been focusing our efforts on the Ember CLI Addon story, and current support the following scenarios out of the box:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Performing operations on the <code>EmberApp</code> created in the consuming applications <code>Brocfile.js</code>. The most common things this would be used to call <code>app.import</code> (see <a href=\"http://iamstef.net/ember-cli/#managing-dependencies\">Ember CLI - Managing Dependencies</a> for more details) or process the various options provided by the consuming application. Examples: <a href=\"https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-pretender\">ember-cli-pretender</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/emberFire\">emberFire</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-ic-ajax\">ember-cli-ic-ajax</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Adding preprocessors to the default registry. This allows us to use a custom preprocessor to handle our templates, JavaScript, and/or styles. Example: <a href=\"https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-esnext\">ember-cli-esnext</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Providing a custom application tree to be merged with the consuming application. This allows you to distribute anything that might need to be imported in the consuming application; including components, templates, routes, mixins, helpers, etc. Example: <a href=\"https://github.com/rondale-sc/ember-cli-super-number\">ember-cli-super-number</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Providing custom express middlewares. This allows for an addon to completely customize the development servers behaviors, making things like automated mock Ember Data API&#39;s actually possible. This is currently only available on master (will be available in  0.0.37 and higher).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One of the design goals that the current crop of example addons follow is that they can all be installed and used simply via:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight bash \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>npm install --save-dev &lt;package name&gt;\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h2>Details</h2>\n\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n\n<p>Ember CLI detects the presence of an addon by inspecting each of your applications dependencies and searching their <code>package.json</code> files for the presence of <code>ember-addon</code> in the keywords section. </p>\n\n<h3>Creation</h3>\n\n<p>Once the available addons are detected, Ember CLI will require the addon.  By default it will use standard Node.js require rules (see <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together\">here</a> for a breakdown), but you can provide a custom entry point by specifying a <code>ember-addon-main</code> property in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Either way you go, during the various commands that cause a new build to be done (<code>ember server</code>, <code>ember test</code>, <code>ember build</code>, etc) Ember CLI will create a new instance of the class that your addon returns passing it the <code>Project</code> instance for the current project. The <code>Project</code> model has a few functions that might be useful to your addon. You can see a full list by inspecting the <a href=\"https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/blob/master/lib/models/project.js\">source</a>, but to name a few:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>require</code> -- Lets you require files or packages from the consuming application.</li>\n<li><code>config</code> -- Returns the configuration for the provided environment.</li>\n<li><code>resolve</code> -- Looks up a file from the root of the project using standard Node require semantics, but with the projects root as the base directory.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Build Process Inclusion</h3>\n\n<p>When the consuming application&#39;s <code>Brocfile.js</code> is processed by Ember CLI to build/serve/etc the addon&#39;s <code>included</code> function is called passing the <code>EmberApp</code> instance. You can use this to access the options provided (for configuration of your addon for example).</p>\n\n<h3>Intra Build Hooks</h3>\n\n<p>There are a few other points in the build process that your addon can hook into via the <code>treeFor</code> function. <code>treeFor</code> is called to setup the final build output for a few specific points in the build process. The addons <code>treeFor</code> function will be called with an argument that signifies which tree is being asked for.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the following trees can be customized by the addon:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>app</code> -- The tree returned by your addon for the <code>app</code> tree will be merged with that of the application. This is an excellent place to add custom initializers for your addon, add routes/controllers/views/components/templates/etc (anything that goes in <code>app/</code> really). For additional information read through the <a href=\"http://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/building-ember-addons\">blog post</a> describing how <code>ember-cli-super-number</code> was turned into an addon.</li>\n<li><code>styles</code> -- The tree returned by your addon for the <code>styles</code> tree will be merged with your applications styles (generally <code>app/styles/</code>).</li>\n<li><code>vendor</code> -- The tree returned by your addon for the <code>vendor</code> tree will be merged with your applications vendor tree (generally <code>vendor/</code>). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All of the trees returned by addons are merged into the corresponding tree in the application. The application&#39;s direct trees are always last so they will always override any files from an addon. This actually makes a wonderful place for application specific customization: your addon could provide a good default template, and the application can override by simply placing their own template in the same path.</p>\n\n<h2>Future</h2>\n\n<p>Many things are still planned for the &quot;Addon Story&quot; in Ember CLI. A few of them below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Allow addons to specify preferred ordering (before or after another addon). Similar in concept (and stolen from) the Ember initializer ordering. This is implemented on master and will be included in 0.0.37.</li>\n<li>Allow addons to provide a <code>blueprintPaths</code> function that will return addition paths for blueprints to be looked up. This will allow an addon to override internal blueprints or add their own.</li>\n<li>Allow more than one preprocessor to be used at once. Currently, it is only possible to have a single preprocessor, but this is a limitation if you want both SCSS and plain CSS (for example).</li>\n<li>Expose post-processed stages. This will allow for better customization of the final output which things like <a href=\"https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer\">autoprefixer</a> would be able to take advantage of.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Call To Arms</h2>\n\n<p>This API is still very fluid and not set in stone. We need as much feedback as possible to truly solidify things.</p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ember","ember-cli"],"date":"2014-06-24T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/06/23/kapow-using-framer","title":"KAPOW! Writing prototypes with Framer","dockyarder":"steven-trevathan","body":"<p>I&#39;ve finally used <a href=\"http://framerjs.com/\">Framer</a> on a client project and couldn&#39;t be happier with the result. I normally use <a href=\"http://www.invisionapp.com/\">InVision</a> and highly recommend it, but Framer is the obvious choice when we need the experience to feel significantly more real.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cooper.com/journal/2013/07/designers-toolkit-proto-testing-for-prototypes\">Every tool has its pros and cons</a>, however, so it won&#39;t <em>always</em> be the best choice for you.</p>\n\n<p>Let me start with Framer&#39;s big con: you must write JavaScript to knit a prototype together. The code itself is very easy to learn, but understanding how the Framer script interacts with your PSD&#39;s groups and layer organization is like flying blind. With practice you can get past this and work gets much, much faster.</p>\n\n<p>The one other con is that their documentation is made more for developers than designers. So if you&#39;re not used to digging into developer docs you will likely be overwhelmed and unsure what you&#39;re looking for. Looking elsewhere won&#39;t help you either, there doesn&#39;t seem to be much community around this (yet).</p>\n\n<p>Someone with less coding experience will find Framer difficult and more intimidating than it has to be. I&#39;d recommend dealing with the learning curve by practicing on a few side projects before you put anything important on the line (not that side projects aren&#39;t important).</p>\n\n<p>Where Framer really shines bright: you won&#39;t have to verbalize (or make embarrassing gestures) for how your app should feel, because you define that with enormous control. Oddly enough, the biggest con is your ally here, as writing custom JavaScript is what makes this control possible.</p>\n\n<p>Framer supports clicks and taps just the same, supports many animation options, is highly configurable, and runs very, very smoothly on all (of my) devices. I&#39;ve tested it on iPhone, iPad, and a Mac. Because of this control and variability of use, your prototypes will feel much more real to the user in a testing scenario. This is especially good when your interactions help communicate state and position.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve used Framer before, let me know how you like it. There&#39;s only so much time in the world to play with prototyping tools, but my next experiment will be with <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/origami/\">Origami</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Bonus!</h2>\n\n<p>While doing user testing sessions, you may want the testee to work on the actual device. To do so you can use <a href=\"http://anvilformac.com/\">Anvil</a> to create a local web address using <a href=\"http://pow.cx/\">Pow</a>. This will give you an address (something like <code>http://yourappname.youripaddress.xip.io/</code>) that you may access on your device.</p>\n","summary":"A look at Framer.js, a powerful prototyping tool.","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design","design-process","prototyping"],"date":"2014-06-23T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/06/23/goodbye-heroku","title":"Goodbye Heroku","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>I&#39;ve been a Heroku user since the beginning. And I understand they have\nhad their ups and downs but over the past 2 years the service has been\ndegrading and today was the last straw for me. Allow me to elaborate.</p>\n\n<h2>Downtime</h2>\n\n<p>Today Heroku had a &quot;Scheduled Maintenance at 2pm EST&quot;. First of all,\nthis is just stupid. Don&#39;t schedule a maintenance period at 2pm EST for\n<strong>anything</strong>. That period of time has to be one of the most heavily\ntrafficked timeslots on the web. Its an hour after everyone on the East\nCoast has come back from lunch. It is an hour before lunch on the West\nCoast. This, to me, demonstrates a lack of judgement on Heroku&#39;s part. I\nknow the counter-argument is going to be &quot;we&#39;ve done plenty of other\nscheduled maintenances at 2pm EST without incident&quot;. My reply is that\nthis counter-argument is <em>bullshit</em>. Just because you got away without\nproblems previously doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t happen in the future. Things\ngo wrong, people screw up. When Heroku has control over when those\nscrewups occur and they choose to push that risk at 2pm EST that is a\nproblem.</p>\n\n<h2>Reporting of Downtime</h2>\n\n<p>I am convinced their Status team just sits on Twitter all day and waits\nfor enough people to bitch and complain that Heroku is down before they\nupdate the status page. I don&#39;t care what data they provide to the\ncontrary. Why is the updated status page important? When our customers\nemail us during our vacation pissed off that we are not around and we\nhave <em>nothing</em> to show to them to prove that this is Heroku&#39;s fault and\nnot ours, to me that status page being updated immediately <strong>before</strong>\nour customers discover on their own is very important.</p>\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n<p>It has been heavily reported that AWS has cut their pricing quite a bit\nover the past few years. Yet, how many times has Heroku reduced its\nprice? (Heroku resells AWS) To my knowledge <strong>zero</strong>. So everytime Amazon\nreduces EC2 pricing Heroku just pockets the difference and gives a &quot;fuck\nyou very much!&quot; to all of its customers.</p>\n\n<h2>Fixes for All</h2>\n\n<p>The major downside to hosted devops is that when something goes wrong\nthat affects everyone you usually have to wait until they make the fix\nfor <strong>everyone</strong> before your app comes back up. What should probably be\na 5 minute downtime <em>at most</em> turns into a 30 minute downtime <strong>at least</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Buildpacks</h2>\n\n<p>Buildpacks are just terrible.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>I get that I&#39;m ranting and I&#39;m pretty pissed off. But mistakes like\ntoday&#39;s are completely avoidable yet Heroku chose to expose everyone to\nthis increased risk for no good reason that I can see.</p>\n\n<p>We will no longer be starting any new customers on Heroku. And we will\nrecommend to our current customers to move off of Heroku.

(I always stick mine to a pant leg just because.) </p>\n\n<p>A step up would be vinyl stickers or shipping labels with something like the conference name printed on them, but again attendees must write their name. </p>\n\n<p>At the highest level of badge, you arrive an event and receive a fully branded badge on a colorful lanyard with your name and photo printed on both sides, to prevent you from lending your $800 conference pass to a friend.</p>\n\n<h2>Three things badges do best:</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Prove that you&#39;ve paid for your ticket</li>\n<li>Help brand the event</li>\n<li>Help you meet people</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Our focus for the badges was mostly to help people meet and talk, and if we get to show off the Wicked Good Conferences brand - that&#39;s cool too. We did not rely on the badges for ticketing because the event is relatively small, and held in a single location. There were no repeated check-ins at the door or strangers walking in off the relatively low traffic street.</p>\n\n<p>This allowed me the freedom to experiment with the badges. The only restriction was the budget; we wanted to make about 200 customizable name badges with a budget range of $20\u2013$50. This is not a realistic budget for high quality &quot;professionally&quot; printed badges (decent custom lanyards alone are at least $1 each).</p>\n\n<h2>No printed names</h2>\n\n<p>We decided to skip printing people&#39;s names altogether, and ask them to write names instead. This also allowed people to put a twitter handle and other useful information on the badges, and be funny with them. I am an introvert, so I appreciate any excuse to start a conversation. Stickers, twitter handles and stick figures on badges helped make interaction easier.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/DIY-badges-01.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<h2>No printed lanyards</h2>\n\n<p>Custom printed lanyards, in the quality we wanted, were way above our budget. Instead, we tried a few DIY ideas: string, ribbon, rope and strips of jersey fabric. The fabric turned out to be the most comfortable to wear. Knit jersey (&quot;tee-shirt&quot;) fabric will roll into a soft string if you cut 1&quot; wide strips and stretch them out. We used about 2.5 yards of 52&quot; wide fabric to make the 200 strips. We could make the strips a half to a third of the width of the fabric, depending on how long we wanted the strips to be.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/DIY-badges-02.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>An added benefit of using fabric is a much better selection of colors compared to lanyards. We managed to get a near-perfect match to our attendee shirts!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/DIY-badges-03.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<h2>Actually, no printed anything</h2>\n\n<p>To make a color impression at a low cost we used a rubber stamp with a purple ink pad. We did not commit to placing any sponsor logos on the badges, so I had complete freedom with this design. We ordered a rubber stamp of the Wicked Good Conferences logo by itself so we can reuse it for the next conferences. To make the badge itself, we stamped and punched a hole in standard 3\u00d75&quot; index cards.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/DIY-badges-04.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-assets/maria/DIY-badges-05.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<h2>Budget breakdown</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1\u00d72&quot; Custom rubber stamp&quot;: $12 + shipping</li>\n<li>Purple ink pad: $3.50</li>\n<li>Index cards, 2 packs of 100: ~$7</li>\n<li>Single hole punch: ~$5</li>\n<li>Jersey fabric (we already had it, but if you need to buy it cost about $5/yard): free or $15</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n\n<p>The badges felt about right for the event, not too formal, not too shabby. Some lanyards turned out a bit short, but people were creative with placement, wearing them not only around the neck but on a sleeve, on the hat, tying them to the belt loop or a shirt button, and even wearing as a soft choker.\nNext time around we can also experiment with other paper types and have the paper cut to size, to allow for a sturdier badge in a wider range of colors.</p>\n\n<p>Were you at WGE?

This is the language that is going to replace <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C\">Objective-C</a> in the future.</p>\n\n<p>So why should a JavaScript developer be excited about a language like Swift?\nBecause semicolons are optional in Swift, too.</p>\n\n<h3>Variables</h3>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s declare a variable in <code>JavaScript</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> country = <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Argentina</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>;\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Here&#39;s how the same declaration looks like in Swift:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight swift \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>var country: String = &quot;Argentina&quot;;\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>However, the same statement can be rewritten as such:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight swift \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>var country = &quot;Argentina&quot;; // inferred as String\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Swift uses type inference. It looks on the right hand side of the assignment\nto figure out the type of the variable.</p>\n\n<p>Swift is type safe language. It performs type checks during compilation time\nand informs you if there are any type mismatch errors. Unlike in JavaScript,\nthat means that after you defined <code>country</code> variable and its type was\ninferred to be <code>String</code>, you can&#39;t re-assign with another type:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight swift \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>country = 2; // Cannot convert the expression's type to type 'String'\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Constants</h3>\n\n<p>JavaScript doesn&#39;t have a concept of a <code>constant</code>. All &quot;constants&quot; are just\nvariables (typically in the outer scope). You can &quot;freeze&quot; the object using\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze\">Object.freeze()</a>\nto prevent new properties to be added and existing properties to be removed.</p>\n\n<p>The next version of JavaScript is going to introduce <a href=\"https://people.mozilla.org/%7Ejorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-13.2.1\">const</a>\nkeyword and will support constants:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>const y = <span class=\"integer\">10</span>; <span class=\"comment\">// Note that you need to specift the value of the constant</span>\ny = <span class=\"integer\">20</span>;       <span class=\"comment\">// SyntaxError: Assignment to constant variable</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>If you want to define a constant in Swift, you will use <code>let</code> keyword:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight swift \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>let bestCity = &quot;Boston&quot;;\nbestCity = &quot;Cape Town&quot;; // Cannot assign to 'let' value 'bestCity'\n\n// Swift allows you to use underscore as a delimiter\n// to improve readability of your code\nlet oneMillion = 1_000_000;\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Tuples</h3>\n\n<p>So what is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple\">tuple</a>? TL;DR it&#39;s an ordered list of things.</p>\n\n<p>You can think of a tuple as if it&#39;s an object:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> villain = {\n  <span class=\"key\">name</span>:     <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Magneto</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>,\n  <span class=\"key\">realName</span>: <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Max Eisenhardt</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>,\n  <span class=\"key\">powers</span>:   [<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Magnetic flight</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Magnetic force fields</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>]\n};\n\nvillain.name; <span class=\"comment\">// =&gt; 'Magneto'</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>In Swift, the declaration of a tuple will look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight swift \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>let villain = (\n  name:     &quot;Magneto&quot;,\n  realName: &quot;Max Eisenhardt&quot;,\n  powers:   [&quot;Magnetic flight&quot;, &quot;Magnetic force fields&quot;]\n);\n\nvillain.name; // =&gt; &quot;Magneto&quot;\nvillain.1;    // =&gt; &quot;Max Eisenhardt&quot;\nvillain.2;    // =&gt; [...]\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Tuples are useful when you want to return multiple values from a function as a single compound value (that is\nexactly what we do so often in JavaScript).</p>\n\n<h3>Arrays and Dictionaries</h3>\n\n<p>Definining an array or a dictionary looks very similar.</p>\n\n<p>In JavaScript:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> names = [<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Alex</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Rob</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Dan</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>];\n<span class=\"keyword\">var</span> ages  = { <span class=\"key\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Alex</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>: <span class=\"integer\">13</span>, <span class=\"key\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Rob</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>: <span class=\"integer\">5</span>, <span class=\"key\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Dan</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>: <span class=\"integer\">4</span> };\n\nnames[<span class=\"integer\">0</span>];     <span class=\"comment\">// =&gt; 'Alex'</span>\nages[<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Alex</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>]; <span class=\"comment\">// =&gt; 13</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>In Swift:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight swift \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>var names = [&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Rob&quot;, &quot;Dan&quot;];\nvar ages  = [&quot;Alex&quot;: 13, &quot;Rob&quot;: 5, &quot;Dan&quot;: 4];\n\nnames[0];     // =&gt; &quot;Alex&quot;\nages[&quot;Alex&quot;]; // 13\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Generics</h3>\n\n<p>In a very generic, hand wavy terms <code>Generics</code> introduce type safety and reusability of the code. They&#39;re frequently used\nin classes and methods that operate on them.</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate what <code>Generics</code> are, let&#39;s implement a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)\"><code>Queue</code></a>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"function\">Queue</span>() {\n  <span class=\"local-variable\">this</span>._queue = [];\n}\n\nQueue.prototype.<span class=\"function\">enqueue</span> = <span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(item) {\n  <span class=\"local-variable\">this</span>._queue.push(item);\n}\n\nQueue.prototype.<span class=\"function\">dequeue</span> = <span class=\"keyword\">function</span>() {\n <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"local-variable\">this</span>._queue.shift();\n}\n\n<span class=\"keyword\">var</span> queue = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> Queue();\n\nqueue.enqueue(<span class=\"integer\">2</span>);\nqueue.enqueue(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">3</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>);\nqueue.enqueue(<span class=\"float\">0.5</span>);\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now wasn&#39;t that easy, eh?</p>\n\n<p>Note, that you don&#39;t have to care about types in JavaScript that much. You just <code>enqueue</code> a value of any type\nand you&#39;re all set.</p>\n\n<p>Swift is different. You can&#39;t push objects of different types onto the array.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a <code>Queue</code> class for <code>Integer</code> values:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight swift \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>class Queue {\n  var _queue = Int[]();\n\n  func enqueue(item: Int) {\n    _queue.append(item);\n  }\n\n  func dequeue() -&gt; Int {\n    return _queue.removeAtIndex(0);\n  }\n}\n\nvar queue = Queue();\n\nqueue.enqueue(2);\nqueue.enqueue(3);\nqueue.enqueue(4);\nqueue.enqueue(&quot;4&quot;); // Cannot convert the expression's type to type 'Int'\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>What if you want to create a <code>Queue</code> class for <code>String</code> values? You&#39;re going to have copy implementation of <code>Queue&lt;Int&gt;</code> class\nand replace <code>Int</code> with <code>String</code>. A lot of code duplication. Here&#39;s where <code>Generics</code> shine.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight swift \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n<strong>20</strong>\n21\n22\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>class Queue&lt;T&gt; {\n  var _queue = T[]();\n\n  func enqueue(item: T) {\n    _queue.append(item);\n  }\n\n  func dequeue() -&gt; T {\n    return _queue.removeAtIndex(0);\n  }\n}\n\nvar intQueue    = Queue&lt;Int&gt;();\nvar stringQueue = Queue&lt;String&gt;();\n\nintQueue.enqueue(2);\nintQueue.enqueue(3);\nintQueue.enqueue(4);\n\nstringQueue.enqueue(&quot;2&quot;);\nstringQueue.enqueue(&quot;3&quot;);\nstringQueue.enqueue(&quot;4&quot;);\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now you can create <code>Queue</code> of the different types with just one <code>Queue</code> implementation.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>Swift is a step in the right direction in my opinion. They lowered the &quot;language ramp up&quot; time by simplifying Objective-C syntax\nquite a bit without damaging the power of the language. I feel like it looks really compelling to JavaScript developers.</p>\n","summary":"Swift explained for JavaScript developers","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["javascript","swift"],"date":"2014-06-15T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/06/06/process-paradox","title":"The Process Paradox","dockyarder":"jon-lacks","body":"<p>If it feels like process, it is not working\u2026 It should feel like a logical means to achieve an end.</p>\n\n<p>For much of my career as a Project Manager I have been inundated with software development process, theories, techniques, methodologies and related tools - which by association has trickled into the teams I have worked with.  Over time I have observed team members feeling the frustration that \u201cProcess\u201d can bring to a project when it is applied in a theoretical way vs. a practical way.  Have you ever facilitated a planning meeting while team members glaze over and bury their heads into their laptops? To all my Project Management brethren - if this is something you are observing in your teams, don\u2019t accept this reality; realize that your process &quot;is not working&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>The art of project management is not dictating process but finding practices that align with the team\u2019s needs and context.   For purposes of this blog post these are the \u201clogical means\u201d I refer to in my opening statement above.  A little Scrum here, a little Waterfall there, and a sprinkle of Kanban might be the right recipe for a particular project - whereas it could be totally wrong for another.   </p>\n\n<p>In many ways this context is driven by the pyramid of constraints - cost/scope/time, which is project management 101.  However, other contexts might be size of team, remote/co-located, green-field development, team member experience, criticality of deliverables to human life, number of stakeholders, thick/thin management hierarchy, complexity of business rules/logic, and many others which are industry specific.  </p>\n\n<p>One of my biggest gripes with the \u201cAgile\u201d movement is that companies/teams are adopting variations of the methodology as a prescription to execute projects. I am pretty damn sure the pioneering thinkers who wrote the Agile Manifesto wanted teams to become more principled in thinking about the practices they chose to use vs. following the playbook blindly and not making sure it aligns with the project context.</p>\n\n<p>It has been very affirming to know that engineers and designers in large and small companies loath process \u2013 I\u2019d say this is pretty universal. However, I have found that these same people are incredibly logical people who are willing to do something non-engineering/design related if  they feel deep down it is a \u201clogical means to achieve an end.\u201d I believe it is the project manager\u2019s responsibility as a servant leader to make sure teams don\u2019t feel like process is holding them back but that it is helping them move forward.</p>\n\n<p>What I love about being a Project Manager at DockYard is the diversity of the project contexts that come through our door. For me it is and has been a great way to experiment, mix, and match processes to find the right practices for a team/project context.  I believe that DockYard\u2019s acknowledgment of this reality allows us to better serve our clients\u2019 unique contexts.  Not by accident - it is a very deliberate way to approach projects and one size never fits all.   </p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["process","agile"],"date":"2014-06-06T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/05/31/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-part-4","title":"Building an Ember App with Rails Part 4","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p><em>This is a four-part series:\n<a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/05/07/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-part-1.html\">Part 1</a>,\n<a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/05/08/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-part-2.html\">Part 2</a>,\n<a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/05/09/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-part-3.html\">Part 3</a>,\n<a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/05/31/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-part-4.html\">Part 4</a></em></p>\n\n<p>Before we get underway we need to update ember-data in our project to at\nleast <code>1.0.0-beta.8</code>.

href=\"https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/\">ActiveModel::Serializers</a>\nfor small data sets, and 160X faster for larger data sets?</p>\n\n<p>Typically when you have an API serving up JSON responses, your web\nframework serializes your data after retrieving it with its ORM. We&#39;ll\ntalk about Rails specifically in this article, but this will generally\napply to most frameworks. So the typical Rails request will roughly\nfollow this flow (I am purposely brushing over some parts of the request\nresponse cycle):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Rails receives the JSON request from the browser/client</li>\n<li>Rails will apply some business logic and craft a query via\n ActiveRecord</li>\n<li>ActiveRecord serializes its query and sends the query to PostgreSQL</li>\n<li>PostgreSQL will compile the result set and serializes the records\n in its protocol format</li>\n<li>ActiveRecord deserializes the records into a set of rows object</li>\n<li>ActiveRecord will convert the set of rows into a set of model\n object instances</li>\n<li>Rails will convert the set of models objects into a JSON string</li>\n<li>Rails will send the JSON string down to the browser</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Most of the time in this response cycle is spent in steps 6 and 7. Rails\nhas to deserialize one format, then store that deserialized content in\nmemory just to serialize it in a different format. Since <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-json.html\">PostgreSQL\nsupports JSON responses</a>,\nwe can use its <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-json.html\">JSON functions</a> to\nserialized our result set. That JSON response will still be serialized\nin PostgreSQL&#39;s protocol format, but ActiveRecord can deserialize it as\na single string object, instead of a set of objects which it then\nconverts and reserializes. We end up having this response cycle instead:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Rails receives the JSON request from the browser/client</li>\n<li>Rails will apply some business logic and craft a query via\n ActiveRecord</li>\n<li>ActiveRecord serializes its query and sends the query to PostgreSQL</li>\n<li>PostgreSQL will compile the result set, serializes it as JSON then \n serializes the JSON in its protocol format</li>\n<li>ActiveRecord deserializes the protocal format into a single JSON\n string</li>\n<li>Rails will send the JSON string down to the browser</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We are only removing 2 steps, but it is the bulk of the time spent\ngenerating the response. We are also limiting the number of ruby objects\ncreated, so this reduces memory usage and time spent garbage collecting\nshort lived Ruby objects used only for JSONification.</p>\n\n<h1>What Do We Gain by Generating Massive Queries for PostgreSQL</h1>\n\n<p>It takes a lot of work to tell PostgreSQL to generate a specific\nJSON object; what exactly does that buy us?\nBy doing all this in PostgreSQL, we avoid using CPU cycles\nand memory on our web server. I&#39;ve done some very naive and basic\ntesting with a new, unoptimized Rails project, and a database of 1000\nnotes, each have 10 unique tags, totalling 10000 tags. When retrieving\nall 11000 records with Rails and <a href=\"https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers\">ActiveModel::Serializers</a>, it took\nroughly 9 seconds to generate the request. Most of the time was spent\nin the View generating the JSON object in memory, with 657 milliseconds\nin ActiveRecord, which (I think until someone tells me otherwise)\nincludes creating all the model instances.</p>\n\n<p>When we apply the PostgreSQL technique outlined later in this article to the\nsame result set, the response only takes 72 milliseconds for the first\nrequest. If we rerun this same request, PostgreSQL caching kicks in and\nthe response time is 54 milliseconds. That is a <strong>~160X</strong> throughput\nincrease when we use PostgreSQL to generate JSON payloads.</p>\n\n<p>The above numbers are a bit skewed by the size of this test payload.\n11000 objects would be completely crazy to present to an end user. If we\npare back our result set 10 notes and 100 tags, the first and second\nresponse times for Ruby side JSONification  are 187 and 118 milliseconds.\nWhen using PostgreSQL to generate our JSON payload, the response times\nare 92 and 12 milliseconds. That is a <strong>2X/10X</strong> increase. By utilizing\nPostgreSQL, we can increase our applications&#39; response times and\nthroughput.</p>\n\n<h1>Announce PostgresExt-Serializers</h1>\n\n<p>To utilize PostgreSQL, we have to generate a fairly complex query\nmanually. That is, until you include the <a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/postgres_ext-serializers\">PostgresExt-Serializers</a>\ngem into the project. PostgresExt-Serializers (PES) monkey\npatches ActiveModel::Serializers (AMS),\nand anywhere an ActiveRecord::Relation is serialized by AMS, PES will\ntake over and push the work to PostgreSQL. I wanted to use the awesome\nwork of AMS&#39;s DSL for generating JSON schemas without having to duplicate\nthat work. I am finding some pain points in terms of extracting the\ninformation I need to generate the SQL query from AMS, but right now the\ncode for PES is very immature, hence the 0.0.1 release.</p>\n\n<h1>Nitty-Gritty Details About How it All Works: Massive PostgreSQL Queries</h1>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say we have an Ember application that we are generating the JSON\nrequest for. The Ember app wants the list of notes, along with the tags\nassociated with the notes, and we will side load the tags. Side loading\nallows you to specify the ids of the tags on the note, and then include\na list of tags, which will be used to instantiate the tags on the note.\nThe benefit of side loading is that it allows you to save bandwidth by\nuse tag ids and an array of de-duplicated tags, instead of embedding the\nduplicate tags objects under the notes, where you would have to duplicate\nthe tag objects. We only want notes with <code>id &lt; 40</code>, which is arbitrary\nin this example, but, as we will see, has implications on the query we\nneed to execute.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the whole query we need to generate the JSON required, which is\nalso the example JSON at the beginning of this article:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight sql \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table

We use an <code>OUTER JOIN</code> instead of an\n<a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-JOIN\"><code>INNER JOIN</code></a> so that all our notes are returned, even if no tags are\nassociated with it. An <code>INNER JOIN</code> would only return notes that have\ntags associated with it. We also use the same <code>WHERE</code> predicate in this\nquery as we did in the <code>note_ids</code> CTE, to ensure our query only returns\nthe desired records.</p>\n\n<h2>Turning Our Note Records into a Single JSON Array</h2>\n\n<p>So now that we have our notes records filtered down, we need to create a\nJSON array of these records to use in our final query. At this point, we\nwill use two of PostgreSQL&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-json.html\">JSON functions</a> and the <code>array_agg</code>\nfunction that we used earlier. <code>row_to_json</code> takes a PostgreSQL row and\nconverts it to a JSON object, where the columns of the row converted\ninto JSON properties.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight text \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>foo | bar\n=========\n  1 |   2\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Will be converted to</p>\n<div class=\"highlight text \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>     json\n================\n{ foo: 1, bar: 2 }\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>So at this point, our result set is a series of rows with a single\ncolumn of JSON representing the original PostgreSQL row from our\n<code>notes_attribute_filter</code> CTE. We then use <code>array_agg</code> to turn the\nrows of JSON objects into a single row with a single PostgreSQL\nArray of JSON objects.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight text \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>     json\n================\n{ foo: 1, bar: 2 }\n{ foo: 1, bar: 2 }\n{ foo: 1, bar: 2 }\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>will be converted to</p>\n<div class=\"highlight text \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>                    Array\n=======================================================\n{{ foo: 1, bar: 2 },{ foo: 1, bar: 2 },{ foo: 1, bar: 2 }}\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Lastly, we use <code>array_to_json</code> to convert the PostgreSQL array of JSON to a JSON array.</p>\n\n<p>After  combining these pieces, we get the following query:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight sql \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>notes_as_json_array <span class=\"keyword\">AS</span> (\n  <span class=\"class\">SELECT</span> array_to_json(array_agg(row_to_json(notes_attributes_filter)))\n<span class=\"keyword\">AS</span> notes, <span class=\"integer\">1</span> <span class=\"keyword\">AS</span> match\n  <span class=\"keyword\">FROM</span> <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">notes_attributes_filter</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n),\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>which yields</p>\n<div class=\"highlight text \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>    notes    | match\n====================\n[{},{},{},{}]|     1\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>We are using the <code>notes_attributes_filter</code> as our source for all the\nJSON functions, and adding a column <code>match</code> with a value of <code>1</code>, which\nwe will need later.</p>\n\n<h2>Aggregating Our Tag Records</h2>\n\n<p>We apply the attribute filtering and the aggregation techniques to our\n<code>tags</code> table to generate our JSON array of tags.

I am using the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ruby 2.1.1</li>\n<li>Rails 4.2.0</li>\n<li>Node 0.12.0</li>\n<li>npm 2.7.0</li>\n<li>Postgres (only necessary because we are deploying to Heroku)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Versions at or above these versions should be OK for following along. Please refer elsewhere on how to install these tools on your development\nmachine.</p>\n\n<p>Next I will install ember-cli</p>\n<div class=\"highlight bash \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>npm install -g ember-cli\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Confirm that you have <code>ember-cli</code> installed:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight bash \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>ember --version\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>You should see:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight bash \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>version: 0.2.0\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Or a greater version.</p>\n\n<h2>Setting up our project</h2>\n\n<p>For this project we will keep our Rails and our Ember apps in separate\ndirectories with a top-level directory containing the two. We&#39;ll have to\ndo some project generating and renaming.</p>\n\n<p>I first create a new top-level directory:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight bash \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>mkdir bostonember\ncd bostonember\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now we&#39;re going to generate our Rails project:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight bash \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>rails new bostonember -B -S -d postgresql\nmv bostonember rails\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Note how we renamed the directory the Rails project is in to <code>rails</code>. This\ndoes not affect anything in that directory. If you do not have Postgres\non your machine omit <code>-d postgresql</code></p>\n\n<p>Now the ember project:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight bash \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>ember new bostonember --skip-git\nmv bostonember ember\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now it should be obvious why we moved the Rails project.

I wasn&#39;t there, and I admit I reacted to Twitter\nbefore actually viewing it. If you only listened on Twitter your\nperception of the keynote is most likely that DHH is anti-testing. That\nis very far from the truth. Go and watch the video, a lot of what he\ntalks about resonated with me. I still believe in &quot;testing first&quot; and\n&quot;red-green-refactor&quot; but my style is not as dogmatic as some other&#39;s. I\nrely on integration tests quite a bit, and I don&#39;t mind hitting the database\nduring unit tests. Slow tests that actually test how clients\nuse your app are much better than fast tests that actually test nothing.</p>\n\n<p>On a side-note, I would be interested to know what DHH thinks about BDD\nas opposed to TDD, if he even thinks there is a difference. For me I\nfeel there is a distinct difference and I would characterize my style of\ndevelopment as BDD.</p>\n\n<p>But I don&#39;t want to talk about testing. I want to talk about the other\nthing DHH came down on during his keynote: Design Patterns.</p>\n\n<p>Now before I get raked over the coals let me start by saying that\noverall design patterns are great. It was the MVC(ish) and ActiveRecord\npatterns that made Rails itself possible. When we speak in patterns it\nbecomes the lingua franca for programmers. I can jump from language to\nlanguage and can, with relative ease, recognize the patterns.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the Ruby/Rails communities we have gone overboard. Design\nPatterns are the new Holy Grail of software development. A few\nyears ago people were very excited about TDD, as DHH said it was sold to\nus as a necessary tool for &quot;professional software development&quot;. Now that\neverybody just assumes TDD is happening the thought leaders went in\nsearch of the next intellectually challenging concept to hold everyone\naccountable for. This began to spring up maybe 2 years ago, at least\nthat&#39;s when I started to notice it. Design pattern talks at conferences, books\ndedicated to design patterns, podcasts talking about patterns, blog\nposts (of which we have written a few), code schools teaching design\npatterns - developers ate them up. The Ruby community was hungry for\npatterns.</p>\n\n<p>There feels to me a loss of pragmatism in the ruby community. I think\nthis is due to there being no major problems to solve in Rails anymore.\nDevelopers are always looking for problems to solve, and in this case\nthe hive mind has decided to hyper optimize on patterns.</p>\n\n<p>I get it, they are intellectually stimulating. Implementing a pattern to\n&quot;perfection&quot; will give a developer that sense of self-satisfaction. &quot;My\ncode is clean&quot;. Until the next feature comes in and you have to blow up\nwhat you&#39;ve been perfecting.</p>\n\n<p>Be pragmatic. Don&#39;t follow the trends just because some guys behind a\nmicrophone say you should.</p>\n","summary":"The Design Pattern Cargo Culting of the Ruby Community","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ruby","ruby-on-rails","opinion"],"date":"2014-05-06T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/05/05/preserve-scroll-position-in-ember-apps","title":"Preserve scrolling position in Ember Apps","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>If you have a long list of items on a page and a user follows a link\nthen goes back to that list, Ember will re-render the list and the user\nloses their place.

Let&#39;s take a\nlook at each example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>users = <span class=\"constant\">User</span>.where(<span class=\"key\">type</span>: <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">employee</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>)\n\n<span class=\"keyword\">if</span> users.any?\n  users.each <span class=\"keyword\">do</span> |user|\n    <span class=\"comment\"># ...</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>In this first example the <code>each</code> is avoided if the <code>users</code>\ncollection is empty. However, with arrays the enumerator only acts on each\nmember of the collection so we don&#39;t need to avoid if the collection is\nempty. We can refactor the above code into something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"constant\">User</span>.where(<span class=\"key\">type</span>: <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">employee</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>).each <span class=\"keyword\">do</span> |user|\n   <span class=\"comment\"># ...</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Much cleaner!</p>\n\n<p>The next example may not be as straight forward but as we&#39;ll see with\nRuby we can clean this up nicely.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">if</span> params[<span class=\"symbol\">:ids</span>]\n  params[<span class=\"symbol\">:ids</span>].each <span class=\"keyword\">do</span> |id|\n    <span class=\"comment\"># ...</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Here we have a situation where <code>params[:ids]</code> could contain a collection\nof data. Or it could be <code>nil</code>. Because of this we cannot just assume we\ncan always iterate over that value. In Ruby we can create a new <code>Array</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>Array([<span class=\"integer\">1</span>,<span class=\"integer\">2</span>,<span class=\"integer\">3</span>])\n<span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; [1,2,3]</span>\n\nArray(<span class=\"predefined-constant\">nil</span>)\n<span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; []</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Notice in the second example that when we pass <code>nil</code> it creates an\n<strong>empty array</strong>.

If you already have a\nrecord with that value for email in ember-data&#39;s store should\n<code>uniqueness</code> first defer here before we hit remote? This ends up being a\nstrange thing because what if you have not persisted that first record\nyet. Do we only run uniqueness checks against local records that have\nbeen persisted? And how exactly would this fit in if you are mixing your\nvalidations into the controller instead of the model?</p>\n\n<p>If the <code>email</code> example isn&#39;t working for you, imagine you are adding a\nbunch of line items to a parent record. None of these line items have\nbeen persisted yet. And you don&#39;t want to allow your users to add\nanother until the current one they are working on is &quot;valid&quot;. Validating\nuniqueness locally is all of a sudden very valuable. But also very\ncomplex to implement properly.</p>\n\n<h3>No standard yet</h3>\n\n<p>If the local validator is too complex of an animal to tackle perhaps the\nremote validator implementation will be easier. It is, in part at least.\nWe can rely on <code>Ember.run.debounce</code> to ensure the the remote validator\ndoesn&#39;t fire too frequenly when many changes are happening to the value\nof a property.

But I don&#39;t think this is anywhere on their\nradar.</p>\n\n<p>This being said, there is a possible solution. One of my co-workers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/linstula\">Lin\nReid</a> has put together a PR for\nintroducing remote uniqueness to ember-validations. It is lacking tests\n(hint hint, Lin!) but I think <a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-validations/pull/117\">this is moving in the right\ndirection</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize, uniqueness is not forgotten. It is just a pain in the ass\nto do properly.

What is\nthis? Why is it important?</p>\n\n<p>If you come from a Rails background then you are used to the validations\nbeing stored in an array on the instance of the model. When you validate\nyour model all of those validations will be run and an errors object is\nproduced. If you make a change to a property you have to run the\nvalidations again to determine the validity of the model.</p>\n\n<p>I would refer to the style of\nvalidations described above as <em>lazy validations</em>. Meaning the\nvalidity of the model may not be truly representative of its\ncurrent state. We have to opt-into running the validations again to\ndetermine this. Fortunately in most cases, the validations will run for us\nbefore we save. On the server this all happens within a request/response\ncycle so we don&#39;t really care too much about the validations\nbeing lazy because we care about the final result, not the state of the\nmodel at any given point during that cycle.</p>\n\n<p>ember-validations has <em>eager validations</em>. This means when the property\nthat is associated with any number of validations changes those\nvalidations will run again to determine the state of the model. This is\ngreat for client side apps that need to show the current state of the\nentire model any time you make a change, say during a user sign up. I\nmight want to disable the Submit button if there are any failing\nvalidations. If I make a correction I want the error message to go away\nonce the correction is made. I should not have to wait upon form\nsubmission to see my errors.</p>\n\n<p>How does ember-validations do this? Let&#39;s say you have the following\nvalidations:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> UsersController =\nEmber.ObjectController.extend(Ember.Validations.Mixin, {\n  <span class=\"key\">validations</span>: {\n    <span class=\"key\">firstName</span>: {\n      <span class=\"key\">presence</span>: <span class=\"predefined-constant\">true</span>,\n      <span class=\"key\">length</span>: <span class=\"integer\">5</span>\n    },\n    <span class=\"key\">password</span>: {\n      <span class=\"key\">confirmation</span>: <span class=\"predefined-constant\">true</span>\n    }\n  }\n});\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>There are 3 validations on 2 properties. Each validation is an\ninstantiated class that can observe the one or more properties. In the\ncase of the <code>firstName</code> property the <code>Presence</code> and <code>Length</code> validators\nare observing it. The <code>Confirmation</code> validator is actually\nobserving <code>password</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>passwordConfirmation</code> for changes. Each\nvalidator has a <code>isValid</code> flag that is set to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>\ndepending upon the result. Each of these validators are pushed onto a\n<code>_validators</code> array and the parent object is observing\n<code>_validators.@each.isValid</code> for any changes. If any of the validators\nare <code>false</code> the parent&#39;s <code>isValid</code> state is now <code>false</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Please take a moment to re-read the above paragraph because it is very\nimportant to have a good handle on this before we move forward. <strong>The\nvalidating object&#39;s <code>isValid</code> flag is the result of its validator&#39;s\n<code>isValid</code> flags</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because we are in quack-quack duck-typed JavaScript we don&#39;t <strong>have</strong> to\npass validator instances into the <code>_validators</code> array. <em>What if we pass\nanother validatable object?</em> Now things get interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say we have a <code>Profile</code> that belongs to a <code>User</code>. The <code>Profile</code>\ncan have its own set of validations as well as its own <code>isValid</code> flag.\nIf the <code>Profile</code> is mixed into the <code>Users</code>&#39;s validation graph then the\n<code>User</code> will be invalid when the <code>Profile</code> is invalid. We can use this\npattern to build an incredibly deep and complex graph where the validation\nstate bubbles up to the root whenever a property change takes place\nanywhere in the graph.</p>\n\n<p>We can do this simply with:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> UsersController =\nEmber.ObjectController.extend(Ember.Validations.Mixin, {\n  <span class=\"key\">validations</span>: {\n    <span class=\"key\">firstName</span>: {\n      <span class=\"key\">presence</span>: <span class=\"predefined-constant\">true</span>,\n      <span class=\"key\">length</span>: <span class=\"integer\">5</span>\n    },\n    <span class=\"key\">password</span>: {\n      <span class=\"key\">confirmation</span>: <span class=\"predefined-constant\">true</span>\n    },\n    <span class=\"key\">profile</span>: <span class=\"predefined-constant\">true</span>\n  }\n});\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Notice <code>profile: true</code> in the graph. As long as <code>profile</code> is the path to\nthe object to validate against ember-validations will work its magic.</p>\n\n<p>However, the above only really works if the validations exist on the\n<code>Profile</code> <strong>model</strong> and not the controller.</p>\n\n<p>A visualization of a complex validation graph might look like this.

I&#39;ll cover the 2nd Q in an upcoming blog post. As far as\n<code>dist/</code> its never going to happen, ever)</p>\n\n<p>Here is the problem. When you are dealing with a client-side model and a\nserver-rendered model there won&#39;t always be a 1-to-1 representation of the\nmodel. In those cases you can rely on ember-data&#39;s serializer to\ntransform the properties on a server-rendered error object to ones that\nexist on the client data model. How about properties that don&#39;t exist at\nall in any form on the client? You could have a validation error on\nsomething only meant for server-rendered purposes. How do we best handle\nthis?</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s imagine for a moment that we can properly map all the properties\nback to their client-side equivalents. Now what? How do you resolve\nthese validation errors? How do you know in the UI when the validation\nerror has been resolved to clear the error message? Are you preventing data\nsubmission until your client model is valid? If the errors are happening\nserver-side the odds are high that these are not validations that can be\nknown to be resolved on the client unless you do another data\nsubmission and wait to see how the server responds.</p>\n\n<p>So to re-cap the two issues are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Potential lack of context on which properties errors can map back to</li>\n<li>Inability to know when server-rendered validation errors are\nsatisfied on the client</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To start to consider a possible solution I think we need to step back\nand consider the ultimate goal of client side validations. In my mind\nthis is purpose: <em>to help the user submit valid data to the server</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Client side validations are just UI sugar. They are there to guide your\nusers. ember-validations only has model-layer concerns, which means you\nhave to provide how the validation errors are displayed on your UI. This\nis why I also wrote\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-easyForm\">ember-easyForm</a> which\nhandles the complexity of what I consider to be best practices of how\nvalidation messages should be displayed and cleared. To fix this problem\nwould have to tackle it from both sides:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How will server-rendered errors be stored in the validation graph?\n(ember-validations)</li>\n<li>How will server-rendered errors be displayed and resolved in the client?\n(ember-easyForm)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Storing server-rendered errors</h3>\n\n<p>If you are already using ember-data then your data model is handling\nthis for you already. IMO you should never mix your validations into\nyour data model, they should be mixed into your controller:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">var</span> UserController =\nEmber.ObjectController.extend(Ember.Validations.Mixin, {\n  <span class=\"key\">validations</span>: {\n    <span class=\"key\">firstName</span>: {\n      <span class=\"key\">presence</span>: <span class=\"predefined-constant\">true</span>\n    }\n  }\n});\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>This way the controller has its own <code>errors</code> object which will not clash\nwith the <code>errors</code> object on your data model. One possibility of\nreferencing the model&#39;s server-rendered errors is to have a <code>base</code>\nvalidator that is not part of the validation graph but who&#39;s errors can\nbe used for presentation purposes.</p>\n\n<h3>Displaying server-rendered errors</h3>\n\n<p>So how do you properly display these error messages? Do you try to\nassociate them with a property? What if that property is not represented\nby a form input? What if you aren&#39;t even using a form? How do you know\nwhen to clear the errors?</p>\n\n<p>I believe this is a complex issue. My first pass at handling this in\nEasyForm will be to display all of the server-rendered errors in a\nsingle place. An upcoming version of EasyForm will simply group all\nerrors in <code>base</code> and display them. These errors will not clear out due\nto any corrections made by the client. They will only clear when some\nother action clears out those errors, for example when ember-data itself\nclears out or changes the content of its <code>errors</code> object.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>This is far from ideal. This moves us away from the &quot;best practices&quot; for\n<a href=\"http://alistapart.com/article/inline-validation-in-web-forms\">high conversion forms outlined by Luke\nWroblewski</a>.\nBut it is better than not guiding your users. If the server errors for\nany given reason we don&#39;t want our users sitting there without any\nfeedback.</p>\n\n<p>I am very interested in other approaches and brainstorming on the best\ndirection for this.

One thing that stands out: good design can support the message and content in a quiet, almost invisible way. This principle applies in all areas of design, but I am particularly focusing on elegant solutions in web interfaces. It is a pleasure to observe, and sometimes find myself, effective use of subtle visual changes. </p>\n\n<p>The principle of quiet, effective solutions comes up most often when my work-in-progress is reviewed by the whole team. In most cases, I find that I start a design with many elements in a very \u201cloud\u201d state, then evaluate the entire layout. Once I can prioritize things on the page, most elements can become more \u201cquiet\u201d.</p>\n\n<h2>Design for a typical case, not the worst case.</h2>\n\n<p>Before DockYard, my process relied heavily on finding out what the worst-case scenario could be, and designing for that. For example, I would consider a very long, but still plausible, title for an article, and then design the header to accommodate that comfortably. I\u2019d always consider extreme cases early on, and design heavily around those. </p>\n\n<p>At DockYard, I learned to design for the typical use case, and then consider how an extreme case would be accommodated. Looking back, I realize that this approach is less limiting and can result in better graphical solutions.</p>\n\n<h2>Information density</h2>\n\n<p>Different use cases call for different densities of information. </p>\n\n<p>When you are scanning through many search results, it is sometimes appropriate to show a lot of detail at once. Search results are basically many repetitions of one type of item. Users may want to compare what they see according to different criteria, and it is useful to neatly show many details about each result. If I\u2019ve done a good job prioritizing the detailed information, many details do not cause clutter.</p>\n\n<p>In other cases, it is more important to convey the atmosphere around a brand, or to highlight one or two primary actions. Showing fewer items and fewer details can work better.  In these cases, the density of information may appear low, but each element has more prominence.</p>\n\n<p>I can make good progress towards solving the layout of a page by deciding whether it is a detailed type of page (like search results) or a page focused on emotional impact, but not details (like some landing pages).</p>\n\n<h2>Does it look \u201creal\u201d?</h2>\n\n<p>Design is often about deciding what kind of animal a chunk of information will be. Through visual design, we have to clearly answer questions like \u201chow important is this thing, relative to others?\u201d, \u201cwhat can I do with this?\u201d and even \u201cwhat kind of thing is it?\u201d. When I show a draft in a design review, I can see how the suggested changes \u201csnap\u201d to something that looks more real and interactive. I believe that the ability to make things look real quickly comes from experience, and also from paying attention to how user interface elements are crafted in products I use every day.</p>\n\n<p>Through regular design reviews, close observation of UI design, and occasional experiments, I hope to continue improving my ability to judge my own work. This will allow for more efficient work, more refined design, and more awesomeness in the future.</p>\n","summary":"Recurring themes, and principles I learned in breaking into user experience design.","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design-thinking","design","user-experience"],"date":"2014-04-28T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/04/28/dont-override-init","title":"Don't override init","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>Too frequently I see the following problem.

The piece I saw was a series of stand alone fruits and vegetables, most of them cut in half to expose their cross section, which all shared a beautiful mixture of what appeared to be wood block print and cut paper. Their geometric and pattern infused forms created lovely shapes alongside color shifts that I\u2019d typically only see in particular vintage illustrations.

Each individual file\npossesses 26 settable lowercase marks. Lowercase marks are valid as long as the file\nremains in the buffer list. Furthermore, lowercase marks can be combined with other\noperators.  For example, <code>c`n</code>, will change everything between the cursor to the\nmark, <code>n</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Uppercase Marks</h3>\n\n<p><strong>A - Z</strong> - These marks preserve locations within <em>multiple</em> files. Also known\nas <strong>file marks</strong>. These marks, which are shared among all files within the buffer list,\ncan be used to jump from file to file. File marks can only be used in combination with\noperators if the mark is in the current file, i.e. when the current file opened contains\nthe global file mark.</p>\n\n<h3>Numbered Marks</h3>\n\n<p><strong>0 - 9</strong> - Numbered marks cannot be set directly, instead they are created\nautomagically and used by the <strong>viminfo-file</strong> (<code>:help viminfo-file</code>).\nEssentially, the numbered marks store the location of your cursor after closing Vim.\nFor example, mark <code>0</code> returns the position of the cursor during your last Vim session,\nwhile mark <code>1</code> returns the next to last Vim session, and so forth.</p>\n\n<h2>Some Pertinent Commands</h2>\n\n<h3>Viewing current marks</h3>\n\n<p><strong>:marks {argument}</strong> - <strong>:marks</strong> will show you all current marks, their file location and\ndestination marker. We can pass in an <em>argument</em> to view a range of marks between two marks.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>:marks aC</strong> - will return all marks that are between <code>a</code> and <code>C</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Deleting Marks</h3>\n\n<p><strong>:delm[arks] {marks}</strong> - We can use <code>:delm</code> or <code>:delmarks</code> and then pass in marks\nthat we want to delete.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>:delm aAbB</strong> - will delete marks labeled <code>a</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>B</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Okay, What&#39;s So Cool About Marks?</h2>\n\n<p>Marks can speed up our navigation workflow! Here are a few examples:</p>\n\n<h4>Discussion: Editing One Large File With Lowercase Marks</h4>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve found <strong>lowercase marks</strong> extremely useful when editing multiple portions of\na file. Instead of using <code>CTRL+u</code>, <code>CTRL+d</code>, <code>H</code>, or <code>L</code> to move up and down\nthe file, you can set local marks at heavily treaded locations at jump back\nand forth among them. Moveover, marks give us the ability to jump to an\nexact location - <em>backtick</em> - or to the beginning of the line - <em>single quote</em>.</p>\n\n<h4>Example: Editing Multiple Files With Uppercase (File) Marks</h4>\n\n<p>When I first started using Vim (and began programming), I had multiple windows\nopen constantly on the monitor.  Not only does it quickly become cluttered,\nremembering which file is which becomes hairy.</p>\n\n<p>Files marks to the rescue!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Here are three files we are want to work on. Let&#39;s add some <strong>file marks</strong>.\nJust like lowercase marks, the actual uppercase letter we use does not matter\nas long as it is unique.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"comment\"># ~/sheep.rb</span>\n\n<span class=\"comment\"># On the word `speak`, place a file mark with `mS` - `S` for &quot;sheep&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">speak</span>\n  puts <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">Baah!

In art and design this is especially true. In a browser, unfortunately, accidents don\u2019t pleasantly surprise you in the way <em>\u201dstatic\u201d</em> designs may. In development an accident means broken code \u2013 plain and simple. You may stumble on a solution, but you\u2019re not going to be surprised by a random glimpse of order and possibility in the muck of your own broken HTML. It\u2019s broken until it\u2019s fixed.</p>\n\n<p>Such a quality of the web is necessary, but I don\u2019t find it very helpful for discovering new solutions to visual or experience problems. In the early stages you become very focused on minute details when you should be thinking in broad strokes. In later stages you find yourself seeing larger visual problems and with less power to change it. In many ways, I find designing in the browser akin to designing in the dark.</p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of browser based design tools attempting to free designers of heavy weights such as Photoshop and allow designers to work without learning advanced HTML and CSS. This is a positive direction, but I still haven\u2019t seen the problem solved without losing the element of discovery. Instead of happy accidents, you may experience a gross misunderstanding between your intent, the front end code of the tool you\u2019ve chosen, and the DOM. Maybe the tools will get better, and I\u2019m sure they will, but I\u2019m not optimistic they\u2019ll be architected to facilitate discovery within the next few years.</p>\n\n<p>For the time being my opinion is that, in terms of process, improvements in web standards and web technology aren\u2019t going to change anything save for ensuring work may be completed in shorter order. We create tools (or products) and advance technology in order to <em>increase</em> efficiency and <em>improve</em> human capability. The computer added efficiency for designers by - among many, many other things - being faster and more forgiving than pen and ink, but we still use these older technologies today in tandem with computers.</p>\n\n<h2>The right tool at the right time</h2>\n\n<p>We can still integrate designing in the browser as a component of the design process. I don\u2019t view this as an all\u2013or\u2013nothing deal and our process should be malleable enough to better facilitate reaching the goals of each and every project. Imagine, as an extreme example, that you were told to integrate sketching into your design process. You would absolutely not render your designs \u201cpixel-perfect\u201d in a sketch book. It beats the whole point of the sketch book and the whole experience would be tremendously debilitating. Instead, you\u2019d probably do at least a little bit of preliminary sketching before opening Photoshop, and return when you need to massage another idea out of your head.</p>\n\n<p>The benefit of designing in the web, or at least getting a product in the browser sooner, is that you can experience it and identify major problems before you\u2019re past the point of no return. This is a pretty well established idea (that I believe in), but just like using the sketchbook we need to identify when it\u2019s appropriate to pop open a text editor and start punching in markup and styles. I\u2019ll kick this off with two cases where I think designing in the browser is appropriate: prototyping unique interactions and defining visual state changes.</p>\n\n<h3>Prototyping unique interactions</h3>\n\n<p>We should prototype and test core product interactions when they are unorthodox. Design patterns should be used where possible, but if we are knowingly going against the grain we need to test that experience in the browser and with users (as available) before making it permanent. This is sometimes after the static design has been completed, but in many cases can be done before anything static has been created.</p>\n\n<h3>Visual state changes</h3>\n\n<p>When following design patterns there are still standard things to be fleshed out in the browser: hovers, presses, clicks, fades, sliding interactions, and so on. Generally, if you don\u2019t know how an interaction will truly feel and it involves a state change: design it in the browser. At DockYard, we often propose a solution first in Photoshop and then weigh our options again in the browser. </p>\n\n<h2>An example</h2>\n\n<p>We completed a project last year with the ambition of the design stage being completely browser based, skipping the use of Photoshop altogether. The benefits of having a usable front end in place of static mockups are great: you can use your app as it is being designed and get a sense of the failure points before they become too ingrained in the experience. User testing can begin earlier. This is awesome. From the outside, designing solely in the browser seemed perfect.</p>\n\n<p>You guessed it: I was wrong. It wasn&#39;t right for us then, nor for that project. We were less focused on the user\u2019s experience and more focused on the organization and creation of markup, styles, and script. We began (and ended) by worrying about and writing lines of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We were worried about front end patterns, but the design patterns we were aiming to support weren\u2019t fully identified yet. We introduced somewhat of a chicken and the egg problem, making our thinking more difficult and more sporadic than it should have been.</p>\n\n<p>For us this meant spending hours and hours tweaking markup, all in the name of being able to feel and test the product as it was created. In some cases, for sure, this can be worth it. In our case we even had plenty of existing design assets to base our web interface off of, but that project had called for too many largely different iterations (and mixed opinions) of the same few designs.</p>\n\n<p>Designing in the browser does not mean your project will turn out poorly. Ultimately, and fortunately, that project turned out well in the end, but we did spend a lot more time getting a complete idea of what we were actually designing and building. Our clients got to use the product before they bought into the concept, which was great for them. For us, however, it was as if we started designing a house by laying the concrete foundation before knowing what we were building.</p>\n\n<h2>Weigh your options</h2>\n\n<p>A successful product depends on its content, design, engineering, market fit, team, tools, and infinitely more. When consulting, those elements are wildly varied from client to client, including the toolset. So we must be mindful of what is necessary, be malleable in our processes, and most important of all: make room for discovery.</p>\n","summary":"Make room for accidental progress.","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design","design-process"],"date":"2014-04-04T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/03/30/magic_behind_es6_generators","title":"Magic behind ES6 Generators","dockyarder":"alex-navasardyan","body":"<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The next version of JavaScript (ES6 or ES.next) is going to have a lot of\ngreat features built in that are going to make developer&#39;s life much easier.\n<a href=\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:promises\">Promises</a>,\n<a href=\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules\">Modules</a>,\n<a href=\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:weak_maps\">WeakMaps</a>,\n<a href=\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:generators\">Generators</a> to name a few. In this\npost I want to talk about generators.</p>\n\n<p>Generators are objects that encapsulate suspended execution context. What the heck does it mean?\nIn other words, generators allow you to pause execution of your code and return a value.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say you need to write a <code>cubic</code> function (for any given number, calculate a cubic number)\nand then print it out.</p>\n\n<p>Code without generators for 10 numbers:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"function\">out</span>(n) {\n  console.log(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Cubic number:</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, n);\n}\n\n<span class=\"keyword\">function</span> *cube(n) {\n  n = n * <span class=\"integer\">3</span>;\n  out(n);\n}\n\n<span class=\"keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"keyword\">var</span> i = <span class=\"integer\">0</span>; i &lt; <span class=\"integer\">10</span>; i++) {\n  cube(i);\n}\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Code with ES6 generators for 10 numbers:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> *cube(n) {\n  <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> i = <span class=\"integer\">0</span>, j = n;\n  <span class=\"keyword\">while</span> (i &lt; n) {\n    i++;\n    j = j * <span class=\"integer\">3</span>;\n    yield j;\n  }\n}\n\n<span class=\"keyword\">var</span> c = cube(<span class=\"integer\">10</span>);\n<span class=\"keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"keyword\">var</span> i = <span class=\"integer\">0</span>; i &lt; <span class=\"integer\">10</span>; i++) {\n  console.log(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Cubic number:</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, c.next().value);\n}\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Can you spot the difference? Generator represents a sequence of numbers and every time you call\n<code>next()</code> it gives you the next number in the sequence (it actually gives you an object back\nwith two properties: <code>value</code> and <code>done</code>):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>c.next(); <span class=\"comment\">// =&gt; { value: 3, done: false }</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Once the limit is reached, generator will return:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>c.next(); <span class=\"comment\">// =&gt; { value: undefined, done: true }</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Pretty cool, eh?</p>\n\n<p>Note, that generators look <em>just</em> like functions, but with <code>*</code>s:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"comment\">// regular function</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"function\">cube</span>()  {}\n\n<span class=\"comment\">// es6 generator</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">function</span> *cube() {}\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>If you&#39;re a Python developer, generators and <code>yield</code> are not new to you. But it&#39;s a big step forward\nfor JavaScript.</p>\n\n<h2>For-Of</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>for of</code> loop is a new iteration construct in ES6 which supports generators. This is really for\nperformance purposes. Instead of returning a full array, you can just return a generator which\nlazily gives values back on each iteration. That decreases memory allocation and you can express\ninfinite data structures (since no array allocation is needed).</p>\n\n<p>A really interesting use case for generators is async operations:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>spawn(<span class=\"keyword\">function</span>() {\n  <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> users = yield db.get(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">users</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>);\n  <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> posts = yield db.get(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">posts</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>);\n});\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p><code>spawn</code> is a function in <a href=\"http://nodejs.org\">node.js</a> that allows you to create child processes.\nYou can read about it <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><code>spawn</code> hands control over the function to the scheduler, which knows that the function will <code>yield</code>\npromises and will send the values back as soon as the promises are going to be resolved (fulfilled).</p>\n\n<p>This is really powerful.</p>\n\n<h2>Availability</h2>\n\n<p>If you really want to use this feature, you&#39;re going to have to use transpilers, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler\">Traceur</a>\nor <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/regenerator\">Regenerator</a>. The reason for that is two new language keywords\nintroduced by ES6 generators: <code>yield</code> and <code>function *</code>. There&#39;s a really good blog post about <a href=\"http://gu.illau.me/posts/polyfilling-generators/\">polyfilling generators</a>\nthat goes in depth about how transpilers deal with the new syntax.</p>\n\n<p>Native implementations of generators are available in Firefox and Chrome Canary\n(you will need to enable <a href=\"chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony\">harmony experimental flag</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I encourage you to play around with the generators and get familiar with the syntax because in couple of\nyears from now, we all will be writing code using generators (hopefully).</p>\n\n<p>P.S.</p>\n\n<p>Great article about <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/1.7#Generators\">ES6 generators</a>.</p>\n","summary":"Overview of ES6 generators","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["javascript","es6"],"date":"2014-03-30T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2014/03/17/emberconf-picks-ups-where-the-rails-community-left-off","title":"Ember Conf picks up where the Rails community left off","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>I&#39;m writing this on my flight from Portland back to Boston. On this\nplane I count at least 12 other attendees of the first <a href=\"http://emberconf.com\">Ember Conference</a>.\nA lot has been said about Ember in the past year but if this conference\nwas any indicator big things are happening and even bigger things are\ngoing to happen.</p>\n\n<p>For me, the biggest take away from any conference is the people and\nthis conference was no exception. In fact, Ember Conf is now my gold\nstandard for a technology event. The only possible comparison I have is\nhow early Rails Confs felt. There is an energy and a scary amount of\ncreativity happening in the Ember community right now. Much like the\ncommunity felt around Rails back in 2006 - 2009 there is the\nunderstanding that those doing Ember now are going to be shaping the\nfuture of the web. Whether that is setting the bar higher for how users\nwill want to consume web applications in the future or being a large\ninfluence on what the future of the web standards themselves will be, Ember\nis the only web technology today that is positioned in the same place\nthat I feel Rails was years ago. We are the rebels. We are the\ncounter-culture. Ember is the future.</p>\n\n<p>But, we&#39;re learning from the mistakes of the past. Where the Rails\ncommunity was the counter-culture of its time it suffered from a male\n(and very juvenile) dominated culture. This culture was the result of\nthe &quot;RockStar&quot; mentality set forth by its leader(s). Ember, in contrast,\nbegan its very first conference with Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale addressing\nthe entire crowd with their desire for Ember to be an open and diverse\ncommunity.</p>\n\n<p>The conference was very well organized, big shoutout to Leah Silber at Tilde. She\nput on a great conference, I&#39;m proud that my company had the opportunity\nto help make it happen.</p>\n\n<p>From a technology perspective <strong>huge</strong> things are on the horizon for\nEmber. If you have been on the cusp of getting involved you will be\nkicking yourself later for not doing so now. If you are already building\nin Ember nearly all of the pain-points that have existed will be\naddressed in the next 6 months. Testing as a first class citizen,\nfastest template rendering of any JavaScript framework/tool out there,\nanimation support, query params, a standardized project structure and\nbuild tool, and there was even talk of how we&#39;re going to package and\ndistribute dependencies. Ember Conf was a continuous roll of one great\ntalk after another loaded with the best tech on the web. I&#39;ve already\nreally enjoyed writing Ember apps for the past year, the next year will\nbe amazing.</p>\n\n<p>I realize at this point the article smacks of cheerleading optimism. How\ncan it be this good? The real secret weapon of any open source software\nis its community. After this week I can tell you that I have not felt\nthis way about a community since the early days of Rails. There is\nsomething very special happening here.

I\nwon&#39;t do a point-by-point comparison to the previous post but I will\naddress some as well as some of the feedback I got at the time. But\nfirst, let&#39;s talk about revenue.</p>\n\n<h2>Revenue</h2>\n\n<p>After our first year we took in about $750,000 in revenue. DockYard\nofficially began in January of 2012  so we had a full calendar year to\nearn. From what I&#39;ve been told this is pretty good for the first year as\na consultancy. In our second year we broke $1,500,000 at the beginning\nof December. I&#39;m happy with that, we doubled revenue. I have set a\nrevenue goal of $2,500,000 for 2014. Assuming there are no major screw ups\nnext year we should exceed that goal.</p>\n\n<p>Revenue is great and all but kind of useless information without our\nprofit margin. We have averaged around 20% profit margin over the past\ntwo years. This year we were averaging in the mid to high 20s before we\nhit a lull at the end of November.</p>\n\n<h3>The Negative Stuff</h3>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s get the negative stuff out of the way first so we can focus on positives\nfor the remainder of the post. We could have done better the previous year, we could have done better\nthis year. We lost money due to decisions that I made throughout the\npast two years. Those choices include two bad clients, a mistake in the\ndirection of our growth, and a lack of experience of running a\nconference.</p>\n\n<h3>Bad Clients</h3>\n\n<p>In the previous post I mentioned how DockYard nearly folded from the\nstart due to a bad client. That nightmare lasted for a year and half and\nwas finally settled in June of this year. It ended up being nearly a\n$50,000 loss for us. I am convinced this is due entirely to poor legal\ncounsel; I cannot stress enough how important it is to have a competent\nlawyer on your side. We didn&#39;t have someone that was willing to fight\nfor us, it cost us big time. We have since retained the law firm of\n<a href=\"http://gesmer.com\">Gesmer Updegrove</a>. They&#39;re pricey, but it&#39;s worth it.</p>\n\n<p>However, before we ever engaged with our current lawyer we unfortunately\nhad another run with a bad client. This time to the tune of $20,000.\nThat hit came this year. What is really strange is that I knew walking\ninto this deal it was going to end badly, and I voiced my concerns\ninternally to my people at the time but I still OK&#39;d the deal and it\nunfolded just as I thought it would. It was a dumb move and we paid the\nprice of it.</p>\n\n<p>One of the plans for DockYard was to quickly grow into the political\ntech space in Washington, DC. I have experience working in political\ntech, I brought on a guy who I worked with at the DNC, and we hired another\nguy I worked with on a political campaign. We started making\nconnections. It didn&#39;t work out. Three reasons:</p>\n\n<h4>Timing</h4>\n\n<p>Timing is everything I guess. Especially in political tech, we set out\non this effort right when the 2012 cycle ended. It was a ghost town, and\nrightly so. There is no reason for campaigns or political groups to\nspend money on development efforts when the next election cycle is two\nyears away. While we spoke with a lot of people that were interested in\nwhat we could do from a technical perspective there simply were very\nlittle groups without any budget at the time.</p>\n\n<h4>The People</h4>\n\n<p>During my time at the DNC I worked with some awesome people. Nathan Woodhull,\nChris Gill, Brent Kimmel, Leo Zhadanovsky, and Nicole Aro to name a few.\nI&#39;ve been lucky enough to work with a few of them since. Unfortunately I\nalso got to work with some really shitty people too. I don&#39;t think its\ntheir fault, the political tech space is a real drag. It doesn&#39;t \nattract a lot of talented people because the money to work on the inside\nis very bad compared with any other job out there. The tone you get is\nthat it is a privilege that you should be thankful for, and perhaps\nthat is the case. But that leaves a vacuum that gets filled with people\nthat frankly don&#39;t know their ass from a hole in the ground. Many of these\npeople are now in charge of making technology decisions in many\norganizations. I have no interest in working with those types of people\nagain, nor do I want to subject my employees to work with them.</p>\n\n<h4>Politics</h4>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always considered myself &quot;on the Blue team&quot; but the past year has\nreally pissed me off. NSA, Healthcare.gov, drone strikes, and the\nPresident trying everything he can muster to go to war with Syria. I\nwalked into our Business Developer&#39;s office one day and I said enough was\nenough. I could not in good conscience do work for the Democratic Party\nbecause of these issues.</p>\n\n<h3>Just Dumb Wasted Money</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://wickedgoodruby.com\">We ran a conference this year</a> and due to my\nlack of experience running an event like this (and to be honest, being\ntaken advantage of by the venue we held the conference at) we lost $15,000.</p>\n\n<p>There were also downtimes when we didn&#39;t have enough money coming in,\nbut I will get into detail about this later in this post. (and the\nchanges we&#39;ve made to hopefully avoid this in the future)</p>\n\n<p>Overall I am pretty proud with our revenue over the past two years.\nWe didn&#39;t start with an &quot;industry superstar&quot; on our team or with a\nsignificant open source project in our pocket, nor were we on the &quot;inside&quot; of\nthe Boston tech scene. We&#39;ve built a very strong brand for ourselves\nvery quickly.</p>\n\n<h3>Open Source</h3>\n\n<p>This is still a financial loser for us. I don&#39;t care what people say, that&#39;s a\nfact. However, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peteforde\">Pete Forde</a> commented on\nmy last post and what he said was absolutely true: it will help you hire\ngood people. DockYard has been making a name for itself in the Ruby and\nEmber open source world. We have a good number of projects that people\nare actively using. I encourage all of our developers to contribute back\nto not just our projects but projects we use on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<h3>Personnel</h3>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve made missteps on hirings, that is also costly. I&#39;ll get into this\nlater in the article.</p>\n\n<p>OK, enough with the negative stuff. Let&#39;s get into what we did right.</p>\n\n<h2>Great Clients</h2>\n\n<p>We have had some awesome clients over the past year and a half. I am\npretty much happy with everyone we&#39;ve had with the exception of the two\nclients I mentioned above. We have kept a balance of Startups and\nEnterprise, but we have been very careful about the people we work with.\nThis is how I have boiled it down to the clients we want to work with:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Can they afford us? If you think it is callous to put this as the\nfirst thing we look for, then you are probably not someone we want to\nwork with. We are running a business and there are plenty of great ideas\nout there and plenty of great people. But the sad fact is many of them\ncannot afford to build the applications they dream of, at least not\nthrough us. Financially vetting clients is very important. It makes no\nsense to waste our time in contract negotiations with someone that\ncannot afford our services. We try to discover this as soon as possible\nso we don&#39;t waste any of the client&#39;s time either. We try to make the\nbest recommendation on the next steps they can take. We never take\nequity.</p></li>\n<li><p>Is this an application we want to work on? I would make this the 2nd\nNo. 1 if I could. While it is very important to make sure we have\nclients that can pay us so we can pay our employees it is equally\nimportant to make sure we have projects that our employees actually want\nto work on. This is something that I butted heads over with our Business Developer\nearly on. He was not coming from a developer background and at the start\ndid not know what projects were good and which were shit, from an engineering\nperspective. Consultancies are a feeding ground for other companies to\npoach from. We try to retain our employees by paying well and by keeping\nthem on interesting and challenging projects.</p></li>\n<li><p>Is this a project that helps us grow? This is something we\nhave, over the past six months, started to think about when speaking\nwith clients. Is this a project we would be proud to put in our\nportfolio? Is this a project we can write a case-study on? Is this a\nproject that helps us make a sales pitch to an even larger client?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If we can stick to these three items when choosing clients I think we&#39;ll\nbe fine. That is not always the case and from time to time we have had\nto sacrifice up the chain. So the first to go is #3, then #2, and\nfinally #1 if we are desperate.</p>\n\n<h2>Our Tech Stack</h2>\n\n<p>While we started out as a Rails shop we have moved very quickly over the\npast year to brand ourselves also as an <a href=\"http://emberjs.com\">Ember</a> shop.</p>\n\n<p>I believe in Ember as a technology, it is superior to any other\nJavaScript framework out there in every way except for the learning\ncurve. I see many developers that I have known in the Boston area hate\non Ember. Good, let them. More for us. We also chose Ember for business\nreasons.</p>\n\n<p>Competing with all of the other Rails shops in Boston is just stupid.\nDown the street we have one of the most well know Rails consultancies in\nthe world (thoughtbot) and within a half a mile we have about 6 others\nlesser-known ones. From an ability perspective we are just as good as\nany of them, but then again that&#39;s the point of Rails. There is no\ntechnological advantage that any one shop has over another nowadays. We\nall pretty much do the same &quot;best practices&quot; and use nearly the same tech\nstack. There is nothing that distinguishes one shop from another. So we\nhave diversified our offerings.</p>\n\n<p>I chose Ember as a technology direction because it was, and still is,\nincredibly undervalued in the market. If I was playing a short game in\nour business I would invest in Angular, it is the tech-du-jour but a\nyear from now I seriously doubt that will be the case. While everyone\nelse is wasting their time specializing in Angular we&#39;re building an\nincredibly strong presence in the Ember world. When the scale tips we&#39;re\ngoing to be in a great position. At least that&#39;s the theory. Time will\ntell, maybe the next time I write on of these I&#39;ll be bitching about how\nwrong I was. We&#39;ll see.</p>\n\n<h2>Hiring</h2>\n\n<p>For the most part I&#39;ve been very lucky with the team I&#39;ve hired.\nRecently we just had our holiday party and I thought on my way to the\ndinner that this is the team I&#39;ve always wanted. I can&#39;t imagine that is\na very common thing for people to think. And that&#39;s not to say we\nhaven&#39;t had missteps.</p>\n\n<h3>Finding The Right People</h3>\n\n<p>For us I hire for cultural fit. We have a good mix of senior and junior\ntalent. If we hire a junior developer I only hire people that show an\nability to learn fast. I really dislike white-board interviews so the\nface-to-face interview is for me to get a sense of their personality.\nThen I will ask some general knowledge questions to get a sense of where\nthey are at skill-wise. I will then send the candidate away for a week\nand give them a project to create. I try to pick criteria that puts them\noutside of their comfort zone. Have they done TDD before, have they done\nEmber? I will ask them to challenge themselves and I will ask for access\nto the GitHub repository. One indicator I use is how soon did the\ncandidate start this project? If it was started right away that shows an\neagerness to complete the work. Was is started and finished the night\nbefore? This might show a tendency to procrastinate and get things in at\nthe last minute. While these may be outside factors I do ask about them\nif they are extreme during the follow-up interview.</p>\n\n<p>Recently we have been able to build enough of a name for ourselves in\nthe development community where we have started to attract some good\nsenior development talent. We are putting a pause on hiring junior\ndevelopers and will likely focus on more senior developers for the next\nyear.</p>\n\n<h3>Firing People</h3>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve gotten permission to talk about this from Russ. Russ was a\nco-founder of DockYard and I fired him. It was around the time of the\nfirst post but I didn&#39;t want to reflect on it yet. In retrospect it was a\nlong-term mistake but perhaps the correct short-term decision. We were\nnot at the size when I was really thinking too long-term. I was not\ngetting from him what I needed and it was weighing me down mentally, but\nthis was my fault. I was not communicating to Russ properly what my\nexpectations were. Thankfully we&#39;re still friends and grab drinks every\nnow and then. If the roles were reversed I don&#39;t think I would be as\nmagnanimous.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve since fired two others. One was my fault, the other was not. It is\na strange thing to fire someone. People try to make it nice by saying\n&quot;let them go&quot;, but in reality you&#39;ve shit-canned them. When you are\nemploying someone, especially at a small company, you feel a sense of\nresponsibility for them. You are paying them money and provide them with\nhealth care they use to take care of their family. I wish we could\nmagically double the salaries of all of our employees but of course we\ncannot afford that. When it came time to firing someone it weighed on me\nand I considered the implications. I never did it lightly, but\nconsidering the alternative, each firing has turned out to be the correct move.\nEven with Russ, he&#39;s done much better without DockYard than he was doing\nwith DockYard. Sometimes its not a good fit, I am guilty of letting\nthings sit too long. I have learned to be quicker about acting upon\nthis.</p>\n\n<h3>Losing People</h3>\n\n<p>We have so far lost just one employee, one of our DC partners Chris\nGill. He got a job with the Department of Revenue that paid well beyond\nwhat we could afford. I was actually pretty proud of him that he landed\nit. I have left enough jobs in my career to know that I never want to be angry\nat someone that has decided to leave DockYard. If it is time to go, it\nis time to go. Considering the number of junior developers we have been training\nup I would like to think of it as an accomplishment of ours to see\npeople &quot;graduate&quot; from DockYard and go on to do great things in the\nindustry. (but don&#39;t leave us too quick!)</p>\n\n<h2>Business Development</h2>\n\n<p>In the summer of 2012 I was overwhelmed. I was Lead Developer, Business\nDeveloper, Office Manager, and Everything Else* at DockYard. The most\nimportant job I had was making sure new business was coming in. But\nfocusing on that was having a negative impact on the client projects I\nwas on as well as training any developers we had that required it. I\nstarted a search for a Business Developer. At first I hatched a plan to\nleverage the recruiters of Boston. It made sense: they already were\ntalking to companies but it was difficult for those companies to hire.\nWhy not just partner with DockYard and rent our services to those\ncompanies? At 8% the math actually worked out in their favor, however none of\nthem bit. I&#39;m still struggling with this one and I think it speaks to\nthe state of recruitment. It was a good business opportunity but they\ncould not think outside the box.</p>\n\n<p>So it was time to find someone for that position. I had never made a\nnon-technical hire before. I had no idea how to do that. I looked\nspecifically for &quot;Business Developers&quot; but that was a bust. I gave up\nfor a month or two then I realized that it was essentially a Sales\nposition. So I put an ad out for a someone in sales looking to take on a\nlarger role, a key role for the growth of a young company. I got about\n50 resumes and brought in two people for interview. I liked them both\nand settled on the one with the better references. It was a great\ndecision. Our Business Developer Dan Crowther has been huge for us. We butt\nheads on a few things; he&#39;s right sometimes and I&#39;m right sometimes. But\nthe fact is we would not be where we are today without him.</p>\n\n<p>It took him about six months to really get comfortable with the\nposition, this is very common from what I&#39;ve been told of those\ntransitioning into this position. He&#39;s helped us open up business we\nwouldn&#39;t have known about otherwise. And most important I can focus on\nother things.</p>\n\n<p>We sell DockYard on the quality of our work. While we started as a\ntechnology company, design has become a large part of who DockYard is and\nhas gone a long way to help sell our brand.</p>\n\n<h2>Design</h2>\n\n<p>Since our first &quot;real&quot; contract with <a href=\"http://openbay.com\">Openbay</a> we\nworked with an outside designer, Steven Trevathan. He was recommended to\nme by two separate people. Steve along with his partner Logan Faerber\nwere starting their own consultancy Dobot. Steve and I got along \nwell and I brought them back for a few more contracts. We bonded over\nour mutual disdain for many of the people in the <a href=\"http://www.cambridgecoworking.com/aboutc3.html\">C3 space at\nCIC</a> and so when we\nfinally got our own office last year I invited Steven and Logan to work\nfrom there. We even brought them along to check out the office spaces\nwe were interested in. This past Spring it became obvious that we needed\nsomeone full-time at DockYard to take ownership of our design. Likewise\nDobot was also looking for a lead engineer. It would be funny if it\nwasn&#39;t so stupid that we were literally sharing the same office, worked\ntogether on several projects, and were still looking for one another. Steve and I\ngrabbed drinks and I laid it out: let&#39;s do this. He agreed and we\nbrought Steve on as our Creative Director and a partner. Logan came on as a lead illustrator. It\nis the best move we&#39;ve made to date. Steve and Logan quickly took\nownership of the design direction of DockYard and have along with Amanda\nand Angelo put out a <a href=\"http://dockyard.com\">website that really represents who we\nare</a> and have also put together some amazing\ndesigns for our clients.</p>\n\n<p>While earlier I mentioned how it was very difficult to differentiate\nourselves from other Rails shops, the one place we can totally do that\nis with design. Ultimately design sells much better than engineering.\nThe engineering part of our contracts bring in more money, so we have to\nmake certain that the design contracts we pick up will convert to\nengineering contracts. We look at design as the best Lead Generator we\ncould get. It has worked, very well.</p>\n\n<h2>Office Manager</h2>\n\n<p>This is one that I was told multiple times that I should do sooner than\nlater. I am very bad with context switching, I have to either do all\nbusiness stuff one day or all of the engineering. I cannot do both effectively.\nAfter hiring Crowther I knew the next non-technical hire I wanted was an\noffice manager. What I did might be considered overboard.</p>\n\n<p>I put an ad on Craigslist. We got over 200 responses. I brought the list\ndown to around 100 and sent out invites and asked people to schedule\nthemselves for an interview through\n<a href=\"https://gb.youcanbook.me/\">YouCanBook.me</a> I blocked out over two weeks\nof time, and broke the interviews into 20 minute blocks. Over 60\ninterviews were scheduled. I ended up meeting with about 40 of people.\nIt was one of the crazier things I&#39;ve done but this was a position I had\nno idea how to hire and the only way I could figure to find the right\nperson was to see a ton of candidates and waited to see what stuck. The\nperson we hired was the 2nd person to walk through the door, Mariel\nEbrahimi. We got real lucky, and I think I even came out of that\ninterview and told everyone that we were probably going to hire her.\nHowever, considering she was only the 2nd candidate I still went through\nthe next two weeks of interviews. It became obvious that she was well\nbeyond anybody else coming in and over the past few months she has kept\nDockYard running smoothly. Being able to let go of these small things in\nthe office is incredibly freeing and has allowed me to focus on the\nbigger picture.</p>\n\n<p>I have been toying with the idea of hiring a Project Manager in Boston.\nWe did that before in Washington, DC but we were in a very different position that\nwe are now and I think the position only works for us, at our size, in\nBoston. I am currently running PM on most projects, at least to a\ncertain degree. I allocate resources, and assign roles. Developers at\nDockYard look to me for what they should be doing next. It&#39;s time\nconsuming and only gets worse as we grow. We&#39;ll see what happens in the\nnext few months.</p>\n\n<h2>Building Our Own Products</h2>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve tried it once and we failed. That simple. We failed for several\nreasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We could not work on the product consistently. This killed us. We\nwere putting in days here and there in between client work. I was\nputting in hours on the weekend and this was burning me out for the rest\nof the week.</p></li>\n<li><p>It was not an idea that was very good beyond concept. We built out a\nmarketplace for Heroku called\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/igata\">Igata</a> It would allow developers to\nsell pre-baked applications for deployment on Heroku. I liked the\nchallenge of building the initial technology. But when I began to think\nabout the long term implications of maintaining a marketplace\napplication I lost all interest.</p></li>\n<li><p>Heroku was too much of an obstacle. I actually went out to Heroku and\nmet with some of their people to pitch them on the idea. They liked\nit but it became clear that if we really wanted to make money we should\njust make our own Heroku and not lose the money on hosting. Then it was\nan easy mental jump to &quot;let&#39;s forget about this marketplace and just\ncompete with Heroku&quot; which of course is a dumb idea.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So we bailed on the application and open sourced it. We are going to\nattempt another product built, this time we are going to save up a\nfinancial war chest so we can dedicate the proper amount of time to the project.\nI don&#39;t mind losing money on projects like this. They are fun to build\nand I think we come out the other end as a better shop once we dog food\nour own process.</p>\n\n<h2>Getting Our First Office</h2>\n\n<p>I was pretty annoyed with all of the entrepreneurial bullshit that was\ngoing on in the CIC in Cambridge. It is a terrible working environment,\nespecially if you are a consultancy. You get bugged all the time by the\nworst people. The space is <strong>incredibly</strong> loud. If you go there to work\non the weekends it&#39;s fantastic. But it became obvious very quickly that\nwe needed our own office. We worked with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jfrisch21\">Jon\nFrisch</a> at <a href=\"http://www.t3advisors.com/\">T3\nAdvisors</a>. We were growing and we need\nspace to grow <em>into</em>. We decided upon a 2,200 square foot 2nd floor space\nin Downtown Crossing. I always wanted an office there because of how\ncentrally located it was. Thankfully, Downtown Crossing ends up being\nmuch cheaper real-estate than many of the other places around Boston \n(although this is already changing).</p>\n\n<p>We had some difficulty moving in. We were supposed to start the build-out\nin July of 2012. I was getting married in late August. The owner kept\ndeflecting us, and deflecting. I went on my honeymoon and when I got\nback I asked him what the deal was. He said, &quot;OK, it&#39;s no longer an\nactive crime scene so I can tell you what happened.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that our office is a floor above a jewelery store. The\nfloor in our office is concrete. Two guys broke down a side door to the\nvacant space, brought some mini-jackhammers and drilled a man-size hole\ninto the store below. They then repelled down with ropes and started to\nclean the place out. There were some silent alarms that were set off and\nthey got busted. Exactly why it took them 2 months to clear the place to\nallow us to build I don&#39;t know. But considering how crazy the story is I\nwas OK with it.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, we finally got into the space in October of 2012. Thankfully no\nmore jewelery heists have happened. We host a lot of community events at\nour office and I&#39;m really happy with that. Currently we organize <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Ember-js/\">Boston\nEmber</a>, <a href=\"http://openhack.github.io/boston/\">Boston OpenHack</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/uxboston/\">UX Boston</a>, run classes for <a href=\"http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/boston\">Girl Develop It Boston</a>, and\nhost <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Boston-PostgreSQL-Users-Group-BPUG/\">Boston\nPostgres</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Starting Over</h2>\n\n<p>If I had to start DockYard from scratch today I would do it differently.\nThe number one thing I would do different is not agree to a partnership\nuntil 6 months out. I would have awarded co-founder status to those\nthat started, but I would have held off on awarding partnerships\nuntil everyone settled into their roles. I think when you first get going you don&#39;t really\nunderstand what those roles are. Assigning roles on day zero\nand expecting everyone to just stick to these roles is not realistic if\nthis is everyone&#39;s first rodeo. Trial by fire is the best way to define\nthe roles. Once that is done then the partnership can be established.\nPerhaps someone that previously thought being partner was a good idea\nwas not actually interested in the added responsibility? Perhaps someone\nyou didn&#39;t think was &quot;partner material&quot; ends up being one of your key\npeople and that should be rewarded.</p>\n\n<p>I would also hire a little more slowly than we did at first. I have not\nyet been able to pay myself what I&#39;ve set my salary to. The first year I\npaid myself 25% of that salary. This year I&#39;ve hit my goal of paying\nmyself 50%. Next year I hope to hit 100% of that goal. Thankfully I&#39;ve\ngot a wife that makes a good living and we&#39;ve been able to lean on that\nwhen I&#39;ve needed to take myself off of payroll. If our situation were\ndifferent I am not confident that DockYard would be around today, at\nleast not in its currently form. I&#39;ve been able to take risks that\nothers might not be able to.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Any success we have had is due in part to not just the great team we\nhave but honestly sometimes just luck. There have been several times in\nthe past two years where I have not been able to sleep due to the stress\nof thinking how we were going to make the next few payrolls. Every time\nwe got lucky, someone came along at the right moment and bailed us out.\nI would like to think we are out of those woods, we&#39;ll see.</p>\n\n<p>One way I have changed how DockYard operates is moving away from always\nnew clients to retaining clients. I had lunch with <a href=\"https://www.assembla.com/spaces/andy/wiki\">Andy\nSingleton</a> and he stressed\nand convinced me that we were throwing away money by always looking\nfor new clients. The really successful consultancies had several large\ncontracts that would span multiple years. It was obvious but I had not\nseen it until it was spelled out for me. So we are going to look to\nretain and provide ongoing services for our existing clients. If\nsomeone is reading this and looking to get started that was probably\none of our biggest mistakes over the past two years; find a client that\nyou might even need to take a financial hit on but is always there to\nhelp you keep the lights on. Looking back it seem crazy that we were\nable to not just survive but thrive given out direction of always\nlooking for greenfield projects.</p>\n\n<p>In the next few years I don&#39;t want to see the same rate of growth we&#39;ve\npreviously had. I&#39;ve said several times to my team I don&#39;t want to grow\nto more than 20. Any more than that and we&#39;ll have to consider some\nserious restructuring of the company. I also feel at that number the\nsmall team we have starts to feel more like a &quot;real company&quot;. We just\nrecently made an offer to a new member of our team that will be joining\nin January. I have not met her yet and that is strange to me, but is\nalso an indicator that we have grown to that point that these things\nwill happen.</p>\n\n<p>I look forward to hearing the feedback from this article. I&#39;m sure there\nwill be people that disagree with some of the things I&#39;ve said and the\ndecisions we&#39;ve made.</p>\n","summary":"Brian talks about what has worked, what has not worked, and the changes that have been made at DockYard during its first two years","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["opinion","business","consulting"],"date":"2013-12-22T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2013/12/19/ember-enum-property-cycler","title":"Simple Property Enum Cycling in Ember","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>This is a quick one.

Then you\u2019d follow this by mentioning something they could improve upon, which is the meaty and true substance of the discussion. At the end you\u2019d conclude by providing another positive aspect, a la the last bit of bread. The reason we had to come up with this step-by-step process when approaching a critique environment was to avoid hurting anyone\u2019s feelings. Rather than declaring an idea as stupid or bad, which honestly helps to accomplish nothing aside from increase the size of a critic\u2019s ego, we had now formulated a way of give important and in-depth feedback that would actually help to improve an idea by simply being kind and genuinely interested in helping. Keeping to this method, people were much more adept to make the suggested improvements rather than declare themselves a failure, giving up before they\u2019ve even begun to start. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s important to remember that your feedback can and should be honest and frequent, but kindness prevails over being an asshole (every time). By being empathetic to the person receiving the critique, you get a better sense of what&#39;ll help them improve, rather than just tearing them down. With this, your critiques become genuine and no longer appear as a means to stroke an inflated ego. Without this, the whole world would be filled with broken hearts and ego-powered douche-bags.

Some may have found a comfortable day job that sufficiently pays the bills. Others simply retired early, claiming to have burnt out creatively, and chose to throw in the artistic towel for a simpler lifestyle, one far less plagued by self doubt and critical objections, I\u2019m sure. Whatever the reason is, we as a society are more often selecting to pursue comfort over curiosity and I believe it\u2019s hurting the progression of our personal artistic expression in both our culture and as individuals.</p>\n\n<p>By choosing to accept what\u2019s handed to you by media, you\u2019re merely absorbing other\u2019s ideas or predefined popular interests that have become media friendly rather than participating as part of the cultural influence. This accounts for many of the current trends that appear in graphic design, illustration, web design, music, and movies these days. How else would you have ended up with Independence Day, Mars Attacks, and Men in Black hitting the top box office charts all within the same year? You couldn\u2019t. Aliens and end of the world scenarios were accepted as hot topics at the time, but are any of them truly remembered as works of art? I would argue the answer to be, \u201cNo\u201d. What makes something a genuine work of art is the passion with which it is made. A fresh and deeply personal idea that attempts to either break the rules of the medium or painstakingly craft them to best suit your particular need. </p>\n\n<p>For example, as soon as iOS7 was shown to the public, a majority of the design community\u2019s reaction was negative. But as soon as this same operating system was made public and write-ups began appearing online from major figureheads in the industry, people\u2019s views started to change, as did their designs. The same people who appeared to be so opposed to this recent announcement were beginning to cater their latest designs to having an extremely minimal feel, embracing extra thin typefaces and overly saturated primary colors. While I for one have definitely come to appreciate specific things about the iOS7 operating system, there are definitely things about it\u2019s design that are not necessarily applicable to other interface scenarios. In short, just because a big company is successful with their design doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right fit for your project. No one\u2019s remembered for who they\u2019ve copied. They\u2019re remembered for what innovations they\u2019ve made or new ideas they\u2019ve brought to the table. </p>\n\n<p>Whether this trend is a culturally specific problem or something that has plagued mankind for years, I\u2019m unsure. What I am sure of though is that I for one don\u2019t ever want to find myself in this predetermined rut. I think everyone has great ideas, and it\u2019s important for them to take the time to properly express them. It\u2019s a matter of finding the motivation in yourself to make it happen and take the risk of making it public. As the great Bill Nye said, \u201cEveryone you will ever meet knows something you don&#39;t\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>I for one keep a persistent list of ideas that I want to explore, both in a physical journal and on <a href=\"https://www.wunderlist.com/en/\">Wunderlist</a>, just so that no matter how random the idea may seem, I can at the very least document it to be reviewed at a later date. When I do have down time between projects, I never have to search too hard for a new one to get started. For instance, my current side project is to keep an ongoing list of fictional band names that my friends and I have collected over the years and make actual merchandise out of them as if they were real bands. I treat these projects like tiny experiments and allow myself to try new things, technically and mentally. That way, when I do return to my other projects, they never feel stale. I\u2019m once again excited to work on them and have a new set of skills or ideas to help make them even better. </p>\n\n<p>This is why I think it\u2019s important that no matter what you do, whether it\u2019s a full time design job, freelance illustration, or something far removed from the art profession you had originally pursued, to always keep your mind fresh with new ideas. Explore all possibilities and try new things whenever you can. The more you create, the more apt you are to legitimately think outside the box, rather than work within it\u2019s constraints. And that, my friends is how you will be remembered, for being true to yourself and creating genuine, passionate work.</p>\n","summary":"Being true to yourself and creating passionate work.","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["illustration","art","design"],"date":"2013-12-06T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2013/11/27/vim-windows","title":"Buffers, Windows, Tabs...

Good news! You can\nopen all files and place them into <strong>horizontal splits</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>$ vim -o file_one.txt file_two.txt file_three.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Multiple Vertical Splits</h3>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t like horizontal splits? Better news! You can open them all as <strong>vertical splits</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>$ vim -O file_one.txt file_two.txt file_three.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h2>Within a Vim Session</h2>\n\n<p>There are two main arrangements for splitting windows, vertical and horizontal. Let&#39;s say\nwe&#39;re editing a file and want to open up another file. We can do the following:</p>\n\n<h3>Horizontal Splits</h3>\n\n<p>This will open <code>another_file.txt</code> as <strong>horizontal split</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>:split another_file.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>You can use this abbreviation:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>:sp another_file.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>In addition, you can specify how large the new split will be by passing\nin a numerical value. This value will represent the line numbers shown within the\nsplit.</p>\n\n<p>For example, this will reveal 25 lines of <code>another_file.txt</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>:25sp another_file.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Lastly, you can open a <strong>split</strong> window with <code>CTRL-W s</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Vertical Splits</h3>\n\n<p>You can open files as <strong>vertical splits</strong> as well.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>:vsplit another_file.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Which is abbreviated as:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>:vsp another_file.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p><strong>Vertical splits</strong> can also take in a numerical value, which corresponds to the\ncharacter width of the column.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>:30vsp another_file.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Finally, you can open a <strong>vertical split</strong> with <code>CTRL-W v</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>New Files</h3>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s create a new file.</p>\n\n<p>Use, <code>:new</code> to create a new file inside the current window.\nAfter you save the file, it will be created within your current directory.\nYou can also use the abbreviation <code>:n</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>:n new_file.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>If we specify the path, we can also create files inside existing directories.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>:n ../existing_dir/new_file.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Use <code>:vnew</code> or <code>:vne</code> to create a new file inside a new <strong>vertical split</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>:vne new_file.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Lastly, we can use <code>CTRL-w n</code> to create a new file inside a <strong>horizontal split</strong>.\nNote that we have not specified a file name. Upon saving the file with <code>:w</code>, we\ncan give the file a name. Such that:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre># CTRL-w n\n\n:w this_is_a_new_file.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Switching Windows</h3>\n\n<p>Switching windows ain&#39;t hard either!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>CTRL-w h</code> = Switch to the window to the left</li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w j</code> = Switch to the window below</li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w k</code> = Switch to the window above</li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w l</code> = Switch to the window to the right</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Moving Windows</h3>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve realized that window placement is incredibly useful\nwhen pairing with another person. Here&#39;s are a some ways to adjust\nthe windows.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>CTRL-w T</code> = Move current window to a new tab</li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w r</code> = <em>Rotates</em> the windows from left to right - only if the windows\nare split vertically</li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w R</code> = <em>Rotates</em> the windows from right to left - only if the windows\nare split vertically</li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w H</code> = Move current window the far left and use the full height of the screen</li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w J</code> = Move current window the far bottom and use the full width of the screen</li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w K</code> = Move current window the far top and full width of the screen</li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w L</code> = Move current window the far right and full height of the screen</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Resizing Windows</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes windows open up funny or are rendered incorrectly after separating from\nan external monitor. Or maybe you want to make more room for an important file.</p>\n\n<p>We can easily solve those problems with the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>CTRL-w =</code> = Resize the windows <em>equally</em></li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w &gt;</code> = Incrementally increase the window to the right\n\n<ul>\n<li>Takes a parameter, e.g. <code>CTRL-w 20 &gt;</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w &lt;</code> = Incrementally increase the window to the left\n\n<ul>\n<li>Takes a parameter, e.g. <code>CTRL-w 20 &lt;</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w -</code> = Incrementally decrease the window&#39;s height\n\n<ul>\n<li>Takes a parameter, e.g. <code>CTRL-w 10 -</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><code>CTRL-w +</code> = Incrementally increase the window&#39;s height\n\n<ul>\n<li>Takes a parameter, e.g. <code>CTRL-w 10 +</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n\n<p>That was a lot to cover, but I do believe incorporating these commands into\nyour workflow will prove pretty helpful.

Many\nin the Ruby community took these rules as gospel, without knowing the\ncontext in which these rules were created.</p>\n\n<p>The rules, for those unfamilar:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Your class can be no longer than 100 lines of code</li>\n<li>Your methods can be no longer than five lines of code</li>\n<li>You can pass no more than four parameters and you can&#39;t just make it one big hash</li>\n<li>When a call comes into your Rails controller, you can only instantiate one object to do whatever it is that needs to be done</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Sandi joined Matt during his talk at Wicked Good Ruby and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=VO-NvnZfMA4#t=1380\">gave some background to the\nstory of her rules</a>.\nTo paraphase Sandi, at the time she was working with a group that had multi-thousand line controllers with\nmulti-hundred line methods. These controllers and methods represented\none end of a spectrum, which made code incredibly hard to read and maintain.\nThey were begging Sandi for guidelines with which they could try to\ncorrect this problem. What she did was create a set of rules that\nlived on the opposite side of the extreme, to force them to meet\nsomewhere in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, these rules are a different way of looking at rules many of\nus strive for in the first place. An example: The 100 lines per class\nrule is really forcing you to create classes with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle\">Single\nResponsibility Principle</a> in mind.</p>\n\n<p>My issue is not with these rules as they exist, but with the\ncommunity&#39;s cargo culting of these rules and treating them as The Four\nCommandments. I don&#39;t have an issue with you following them, as long as\nyou understand why they exist, and you feel as though they are\nprinciples you believe in. Don&#39;t just make five line methods because\nSandi said so, and if you follow these rules, you feel like you&#39;ll be a\ngreat developer. Adhering to Sandi&#39;s rules does not make one great, it&#39;s\nunderstanding where these, or any rules, should and shouldn&#39;t apply.\nSometimes a method that spans more than five lines will be more readable\nand maintainable than the same method spread across five or six 5-line\nmethods. Striking that balance is where the power lies.</p>\n\n<h2>REMOTE</h2>\n\n<p>37signals just published\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Required-Jason-Fried/dp/0804137501/\">REMOTE</a>, a book about\nthe benefits of allowing remote workers. I don&#39;t disagree that\nworking remote has many benefits. At DockYard, we work from home from time\nto time. We also strive to have people in the office more often than\nnot, not because Brian doesn&#39;t think we aren&#39;t working when we aren&#39;t in\nthe office, but because it enables greater collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>DockYard is a consultancy; we have client work with deadlines we have to\nmeet. With having our developers and designers in the office together more\noften than not, it removes the latency from discussing issues. I can\nwalk over to Steve and we can hash out an issue in a few minutes. If we\nwere all remote, I&#39;d have to ping him on HipChat, hope he&#39;s at his desk,\ntry to go over the issue text-only until we realize we need to have a\nGoogle Hangout, etc. It makes more sense for us to be in the same place.</p>\n\n<p>The other benefit of DockYard working from the office is that our junior\ndevelopers enjoy the same face-to-face benefits. Also, body language\nmakes a huge difference when teaching or learning topic. When someone pauses,\nhas a slightly puzzled look on their face and says &quot;....Ok&quot;, it easy to\nrealize that a bit more background on the topic will really let them\ngrasp the topic, but an &quot;ok&quot; in HipChat removes all the body language we\ncould leverage.</p>\n\n<p>Removing the latency between a junior developer having a\nquestion and getting the answer is crucial. If a junior developer has a\nquestion that&#39;s a show stopper, they can feel helpless while they wait\nfor someone to be around to answer that question. That helplessness is\nkiller; it makes someone feel like they aren&#39;t helping, and can\npotentially prevent them from asking other questions. If the that delay\nis interpreted as the senior developer blowing them off, they will be\nless inclined to ask questions in the future, hurting both themselves\nand the team.</p>\n\n<p>A product company that employs experts (or creators) of a framework has\na much different situation, where working remote makes a lot more sense.\nThe conversations they have will be at a different level. They&#39;ll all\nhave intimate knowledge of the code base, and so a few questions back\nand forth or a quick Google Hangout achieves a great deal. The\nconclusion was a result of the context they exist in. Remote workers\nwork great for them because they have the perfect mix of experts in\ntheir domain; are working on products, which have very different\nrequirements and issues of client work; and have a customer support\ngroup, which don&#39;t necessarily need to collaborate while working a\ncustomer through issues.</p>\n\n<h2>Figure Out What Works for YOU</h2>\n\n<p>In no way am I saying you should all work in the same office and\ndisregard Sandi&#39;s rules. What I&#39;m asking of the community is a bit of\ncritical thought. Just because someone smart said one thing, it doesn&#39;t\nmean it&#39;s gospel. Realize that experience has led that person to that\nconclusion, weigh your experience against it, and apply it if you can.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s just not hope that the gods give us food because we made bamboo\nairplanes. Let&#39;s realize that moving to XYZ comes with both drawbacks and\nbenefits, not just the benefits that everyone is touting.</p>\n","summary":"Don't do what others tell you to do without thinking about it","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ruby","community","opinion"],"date":"2013-11-15T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2013/11/11/capybara-extensions","title":"Introducing Capybara-Extensions","dockyarder":"michael-dupuis","body":"<p>Today we&#39;re happy to announce <a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/capybara-extensions\">CapybaraExtensions</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Testing with Capybara</h2>\n\n<p>We love <a href=\"https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara\">Capybara</a> at DockYard.

This is exactly what we\nwant from our tests, which not only test our code, but also\ndocument our application&#39;s behavior. A lot more could be written about\nthis idea, but I&#39;m going to assume I&#39;m preaching to the choir here and\njump into DockYard&#39;s newest gem:\n<a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/capybara-extensions\">CapybaraExtensions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>CapybaraExtensions extends Capybara&#39;s finders and matchers. Our goal is\nto cull many of the <code>find</code> statements from our tests and remove the\nverbose CSS and\nxpath locators that come along with them.</p>\n\n<h2>Finders</h2>\n\n<h3>find_&lt;element&gt;</h3>\n\n<p>The library contains helper\nmethods for finding elements like <code>form</code>, <code>table</code>, and lists, as well as\nmany HTML5 elements like <code>article</code>, <code>aside</code>, <code>footer</code>, and <code>header</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So the above code in which we pass a CSS selector</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>within find(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">form#session-new</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>) <span class=\"keyword\">do</span>\n  ...\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>becomes the following:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>within form(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Login</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>) <span class=\"keyword\">do</span>\n  ...\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>In this example, &quot;Login&quot; is text found in the form. Passing the text contained within the element we&#39;re looking for better reflects what a user is thinking when she sees a form that\nsays &quot;Login.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Finder methods are also aliased so that you can call <code>#form</code>\ninstead of <code>#find_form</code> (which you might expect from a finder method).\nThis makes for better readability with the oft-used <code>Capybara::Session#within</code> method.</p>\n\n<h3>first_&lt;element&gt;</h3>\n\n<p>Each &quot;find&quot; method also has a corresponding &quot;first&quot; method. So when you\nhave multiple <code>article</code> elements on a page with the text &#39;Lorem ipsum,&#39; you can call\n<code>first_article(&#39;Lorem ipsum&#39;)</code> without returning an ambiguous match in\nCapybara.</p>\n\n<h3>&lt;element&gt;_number</h3>\n\n<p>In instances when you have lists or tables and you&#39;d like to verify the\ncontent of a specific <code>li</code> or <code>tr</code>, CapybaraExtensions allows\nyou to target the nth occurence of the element via\n<code>#list_item_number</code> and <code>#row_number</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So given the following HTML:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight html \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"tag\">&lt;ul&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">&lt;li&gt;</span>John Doe<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/li&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">&lt;li&gt;</span>Jane Doe<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/li&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">&lt;li&gt;</span>Juan Doe<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/li&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>You can find the second <code>li</code> with:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>list_item_number(<span class=\"integer\">2</span>) <span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; 'Jane Doe'</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Use these methods for testing how elements are being ordered.</p>\n\n<h2>Matchers</h2>\n\n<p>CapybaraExtensions extends Capybara&#39;s matchers with methods for\nverifying the presence of images, the value of input fields, and the\npresence of meta tags. All of these methods return a boolean.</p>\n\n<h3>field_values</h3>\n\n<p>CapybaraExtensions comes with a <code>#has_field_value?</code> method which checks\nthe value of a form field. Ensuring that your records save and update\ncorrectly should be the domain of your unit tests, however this method\ncan come in handy when you&#39;re not persisting data to the back-end. For\nexample, after performing a search, you may want to ensure that the\nquery persists in the search field after redirect.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>within form(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Search</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>) <span class=\"keyword\">do</span>\n  has_field_value?(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">search</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">capybara images</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>)\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; true</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>images</h3>\n\n<p>Asserting that text appears on the page is easy with Capybara&#39;s\n<code>#must_have_content</code> method; asserting\nthat a particular image appears has always been a little tougher.\n<code>#must_have_image</code> takes a hash with the <code>src</code> and/or <code>alt</code> attributes\nyou&#39;re looking for. You can pass a string for either of these keys, and\nan instance of <code>Regexp</code> to the <code>src</code> attribute when you want to hone in\non a portion of the <code>src</code> attribute without worrying about the rest of\nthe URL.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>page.has_image?(<span class=\"key\">src</span>: <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">http://gallery.photo.net/photo/8385754-md.jpg</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>,\n<span class=\"key\">alt</span>: <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Capybara</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>)\n<span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; true</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>meta_tags</h3>\n\n<p><code>#has_meta_tag</code> checks the <code>head</code> for meta tags.

The <strong>Command</strong> pattern in action!</p>\n\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>Command</strong> pattern suggests that we create objects that perform\nspecific tasks and actions. For our example, the <code>Quarterback</code> object\ncreated a file, the <code>Receiver</code> appended to the file, and the <code>TeamOwner</code>\nobject moved it. Each of the command objects completed their action\nthrough <code>CompositeCommand#execute</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Having one object, an instance of <code>CompositeCommand</code>, that executes all\nstored commands presents us with solutions ranging from simple file\nmanipulation to user triggered interaction. The <strong>Command</strong> pattern\nalso allows us to &quot;store&quot; and &quot;remember&quot; commands prior to and after\nexecution.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoyed our example and go Boston Narwins!</p>\n","summary":"Exploring design patterns and their use cases","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design-patterns","ruby"],"date":"2013-11-05T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2013/10/22/vim-buffers","title":"Buffers, Windows, Tabs...

In this series of posts, we&#39;ll explore buffers,\nwindows, and tabs.</p>\n\n<p>Today, our topic will be <em>buffers</em>, editable files that are\navailable in-memory.</p>\n\n<p>When you first open a file through a Vim session, you are creating and working\nin a buffer, typically through a window. For the sake of today&#39;s discussion,\nwe will consider working with multiple buffers through only one window, our\nviewport of the working buffer.</p>\n\n<h3>Let&#39;s open a buffer</h3>\n\n<p>We&#39;re going to setup an easy exercise for today&#39;s post. If you don&#39;t want to\nfollow along, feel free to try the exercise in your own project.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s create a dummy directory and some of text files:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>mkdir dummy &amp;&amp; cd dummy\necho 'The Red Sox rule!' &gt; redsox.txt &amp;&amp; echo 'Cardinals drool!' &gt; cardinals.txt\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Next, open up the <code>redsox.txt</code> file.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>vim redsox.txt      # =&gt; The Red Sox rule!\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Congratulations, you&#39;re already using buffers!</p>\n\n<h3>Buffer indicators</h3>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s open the <code>cardinals.txt</code> file in a <em>hidden</em> buffer. We can accomplish\nthis through the current <code>redsox.txt</code> buffer by using <code>:badd</code> or <code>:bad</code>. Next, we&#39;ll\nlist out all buffers, hidden or active, with <code>:ls</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre># Inside the current buffer, get into Vim's command mode and use the command `:badd`.\n# List all buffers with `:ls`.\n\n:badd candinals.txt     # 'badd' =&gt; 'Buffer ADD'\n                        # You can also use `:bad`\n:ls\n  ### =&gt;   1    %a   &quot;redsox.txt&quot;              line 1\n           2         &quot;cardinals.txt&quot;           line 1\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>The <code>:ls</code> command returns information about each buffer: the unique buffer\nnumber, buffer indicators, file name, and the line number of your current\nposition within the file.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Buffer number: A unique number to identify individual buffers.</li>\n<li>Buffer indicators:\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>%</code>: buffer in the current window</li>\n<li><code>#</code>: alternate buffer, which can be accessed by <code>CTRL-6</code></li>\n<li><code>a</code>: active buffer, loaded and visible</li>\n<li><code>h</code>: hidden buffer, loaded but not visible</li>\n<li><code>-</code>: a buffer that cannot be modified, <code>modifiable</code> off</li>\n<li><code>=</code>: a buffer that is readonly</li>\n<li><code>+</code>: a buffer that has been successfully modified</li>\n<li><code>x</code>: a buffer with read errors</li>\n<li><code></code>: if there is no buffer indicator, it signifies a buffer that has not been\nloaded yet</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Buffer name: The name of the file.</li>\n<li>Buffer line number: The current line number that the cursor is on.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Working with multiple buffers</h3>\n\n<p>As we can see, our <code>cardinals.txt</code> has yet to be loaded.

We can see that our <code>redsox.txt</code> file is our alternate buffer. Let&#39;s switch\nto the <code>redsox.txt</code> by hitting <code>CTRL-6</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now we&#39;ll create a new text file, <code>worldseries.txt</code>, write <code>World Series!</code> inside that file,\nand check out our list of buffers.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>:e worldseries.txt   # Write &quot;World Series!&quot; inside the file and save it.\n:ls\n  ### =&gt;   1    #    &quot;redsox.txt&quot;              line 1\n           2         &quot;cardinals.txt&quot;           line 1\n           3    %a   &quot;worldseries.txt&quot;         line 1\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Our alternate buffer is the <code>redsox.txt</code> file.

Remember that it&#39;s the nature\nof <em>leaf</em> classes to be simple. If you happen across a <em>leaf</em> class that\ncould be broken up, it might potentially be a <em>composite</em> class in disguise.\nBreak up those actions into individual <em>leaf</em> classes and turn the original class\ninto a <em>composite</em>. All of our <em>leaf</em> classes had a <code>#time</code> method.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>composite</em> class handles all the subtasks, essentially using the child classes\nat its will. We can see that our two <em>composite</em> classes and their methods, <code>FrenchPress#time_required</code>\nand <code>DripMaker#time_required</code>. manipulate the method <code>#time</code> from the <em>leaf</em> classes.\nUltimately, our coffee makers are able to treat each step,\n<code>GrindCoffee</code>, <code>BoilWater</code> and <code>AddCoffee</code> uniformly.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps you with your morning routine!</p>\n","summary":"Exploring design patterns and their use cases","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design-patterns","ruby"],"date":"2013-10-01T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2013/09/26/vim-moving-lines-aint-hard","title":"Vim: Moving Lines Ain't Hard","dockyarder":"doug-yun","body":"<p>In the last post, we briefly discussed the power of the\n<a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2013/09/11/vim-staying-on-home-row-via-map.html\"><em>map</em> command</a>.\nIn today&#39;s post, we&#39;re going to use <em>map</em> again in order to move\nlines and blocks around.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s use an example:\nOur goal is to move the <em>first line</em> to its proper location.

I don&#39;t want to\nwrite about the benefits of using this sweet editor, as that would take too long,\nbut instead, I&#39;d like to share a couple of my favorite mappings for\nescaping and saving files.</p>\n\n<h2>Vanilla Vim: Escaping and Saving</h2>\n\n<p>Escaping out to <em>Normal</em> mode from the other modes in Vim is straightforward:\nsimply hit the <code>Esc</code> key.\nSaving files is accomplished by, from <code>Normal</code> mode, pressing <code>:w</code> and then <code>Enter</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>So... What&#39;s the Problem?</h2>\n\n<p>During a session, especially when I&#39;m writing large pieces of text,\nI&#39;d find myself in a repetitive rut:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I just typed out a couple of sentences and want to save my progress</li>\n<li>I&#39;d remove my left hand from home row to hit the <code>Esc</code> key</li>\n<li>Saving the file required me, once again to leave home row, to hit <code>:w</code>\nand then the <code>Enter</code> or the <code>Return</code> key</li>\n<li>To continue on, I&#39;d press <code>i</code> and type along</li>\n<li>Repeat, repeat, repeat...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See where I&#39;m getting at?</p>\n\n<h2>Let&#39;s Talk About Map</h2>\n\n<p>Before we review and\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=pasta\">copy-pasta</a>\nthe portion of my <code>.vimrc</code>, let&#39;s briefly go over the very basics of the\npertinent map commands.\nYou can find the entire <a href=\"http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/map.html\">map documentation here</a>\nor by typing <code>:help map</code> within a Vim session.</p>\n\n<p>Protip: To open help texts into a full buffer, <code>:h map | only</code> or to open them in a separate tab <code>:tab h map</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Recursive Map</h3>\n\n<p>First, we&#39;re going to talk about <em>recursive</em> map commands. A <em>recursive</em>\ncommand will transform one result to another result, if there is another\nbinding to that key. An example can be found at the <code>.vimrc</code> below.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the basic <em>recursive</em> map commands.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>map</code>  - command to transform the operation of typed keys within <em>ALL</em> modes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can prepend the first letter of the desired mode to <code>map</code>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>nmap</code> - transform the operation of typed keys within <em>Normal</em>\nmode</li>\n<li><code>imap</code> - transform the operations of typed keys within\n<em>Insert</em> mode</li>\n<li><code>vmap</code> - transform the operations of typed keys within\n<em>Visual</em> and <em>Select</em> mode</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For example, if I had this within my <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>&quot; ~/.vimrc\n&quot;\n&quot; Note: double quotes signifies comments\n\nnmap 0 gg\nimap n N\n\n&quot; Time for a little recursive map\nimap d D\nimap D wat\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Since <code>0</code> is mapped to <code>gg</code> within <em>Normal</em> mode, I&#39;ll be sent to the\ntop of the file by pressing <code>0</code>.\nMoreover, while in <em>Insert</em> mode, every character <code>n</code> that I type will turn into <code>N</code>.\nLastly, because of the recursive mapping, typing <code>d</code> in <em>Insert</em> mode\nwill return <code>wat</code>. You can think of it as something like: <code>d</code> =&gt; <code>D</code> =&gt;\n<code>wat</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, there&#39;s a <em>non-recursive</em> map.</p>\n\n<h3>Non-recursive Map</h3>\n\n<p><em>Non-recursive</em> map commands are signified by adding <code>nore</code> after the\n mode modifier.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>nnoremap</code> - non-recursive map for <em>Normal</em> mode</li>\n<li><code>inoremap</code> - non-recursive map for <em>Insert</em> mode</li>\n<li><code>vnoremap</code> - non-recursive map for <em>Visual</em> and <em>Select</em> mode</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>&quot; ~/.vimrc\n\ninoremap c C\ninoremap C nope\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now, in <em>Insert</em> mode, if we type <code>c</code>, we will return <code>C</code>; the transformation of\n<code>c</code> to <code>nope</code> will not occur.</p>\n\n<h2>Enter the .vimrc</h2>\n\n<p>Now that we got the basics out of the way, here is an example of my\n<code>.vimrc</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>&quot; ~/.vimrc\n&quot; *** The Two Hand system ***\n&quot;\n&quot; &lt;Cr&gt; signifies the &quot;return&quot; key\n\ninoremap ;a &lt;Esc&gt;\ninoremap ;d &lt;Esc&gt;:update&lt;Cr&gt;\ninoremap ;f &lt;C-O&gt;:update&lt;Cr&gt;\nnnoremap ;f :update&lt;CR&gt;\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>I&#39;m using <code>:update</code> here, which is &quot;like <code>:write</code>, but only write when the buffer has been\nmodified.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s go over these mappings.</p>\n\n<p>The first one, <code>inoremap ;a &lt;Esc&gt;</code> maps the <em>semi-colon</em> and <em>a</em> key\ntogether when in <em>Insert</em> mode. By pressing <code>;</code> and then <code>a</code> immediately afterwards, we mimic\nthe functionality of the <em>Escape</em> key.</p>\n\n<p>The second map, <code>inoremap ;d &lt;Esc&gt;:update&lt;Cr&gt;</code> maps the <em>semi-colon</em> and the <em>d</em> key.\nPressing <code>;</code> and then <code>d</code> immediately afterwards returns the sequence of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>From <em>Insert</em> mode, escape to <em>Normal</em> mode</li>\n<li>Type <code>:</code> to get inside the <em>Command</em> mode, and type the <code>update</code>\ncommand</li>\n<li>Complete the sequence by &quot;hitting&quot; <em>Return</em>, thus saving the file</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The third map command, <code>inoremap ;f &lt;C-O&gt;:update&lt;Cr&gt;</code>, allows us to\ntype <code>;</code> and then <code>f</code> to return:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>From <em>Insert</em> mode, escape out to <em>Normal</em> with <code>&lt;C-O&gt;</code>, which allows\nus to escape out for <em>ONE</em> command.</li>\n<li>Type <code>:</code> to get inside <em>Command</em> mode, and then type <code>udpate</code>. This is\nour one command for <code>&lt;C-O&gt;</code></li>\n<li>&quot;Hit&quot; the <em>Return</em>, thus saving the file</li>\n<li>We&#39;re back in <em>Insert</em> mode, thanks to <code>&lt;C-O&gt;</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, the <code>nnoremap ;f :update&lt;CR&gt;</code> mapping means by typing <code>;</code> and\nthen <code>f</code> in <em>Normal</em> mode, it will result in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Since, we&#39;re already in <em>Normal</em> mode, we get into <em>Command</em> mode by\ntyping <code>:</code></li>\n<li>Type the <code>update</code> command</li>\n<li>&quot;Hit&quot; the <em>Return</em> key, and save the file</li>\n<li>We remain in <em>Normal</em> mode</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The snippet below restricts these commands to your right hand.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>&quot; ~/.vimrc\n&quot; *** The Right Hand system ***\n\ninoremap ;l &lt;Esc&gt;\ninoremap ;k &lt;Esc&gt;:update&lt;Cr&gt;\ninoremap ;j &lt;C-O&gt;:update&lt;Cr&gt;\nnnoremap ;j :update&lt;CR&gt;\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>As you can see, I kept <code>;</code> as a prefix to my map commands.

You have something that you want to track the change of. You add an observer to it, so next time it changes, a certain event is going to be fired notifying you that that something has changed.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of observers: <code>before</code> (observesBefore) and <code>after</code> (observes). When observer event (callback) is fired, it&#39;s called with two arguments: <code>obj</code> and <code>keyName</code>. It doesn&#39;t pass the value of the property to the event (callback). The reason is because the property you&#39;re watching might be lazily computed.</p>\n\n<p><code>Observers</code> are used by CP internally to invalidate CP&#39;s cache when its dependency keys were changed. Observers (like CPs) don&#39;t use runloop magic (fired &quot;right away&quot;).</p>\n\n<p><code>Observers</code> are not going to fire if the value is unchanged from before (changing existing <code>lastName</code> from <code>Stark</code> to <code>Stark</code> won&#39;t trigger the observer callback).</p>\n\n<p><code>Bindings</code> is an internal concept that is not meant to be used. I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t, it&#39;s better not to. Typically, you don&#39;t need to use it in your application, using CP is plenty enough.</p>\n\n<p><code>Bindings</code> are meant to keep a property of two objects in sync. Their update (sync) happens through run loop, so there might be a period of time when two objects have the same property with different values and only by the end of a <code>sync</code> queue those values are going to be the same.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in Ember those two objects are controller and view (any time a controller&#39;s property changes, view&#39;s property changes as well).</p>\n\n<h2>What do I use and when?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Computed properties</strong> are good for combining other properties or doing\ntransformations on the property.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Observers</strong> are good for tracking changes of a property and reacting to\nthem.

By creating the <code>Subject</code> module,\nany instance of <code>Person</code> now informs and updates any <em>observer</em> through\n<code>#notify_observers</code>, ultimately removing any implicit coupling from <code>Alert</code> and\n<code>Agent</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few similarities between the <em>Observer</em> and\n<a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2013/07/25/design-patterns-strategy-pattern.html\"><em>Strategy</em></a>\npatterns. Both patterns employ an object (the Observer&#39;s <em>subject</em> and\nthe Strategy&#39;s <em>context</em>) that makes calls to another object (the\nObserver&#39;s <em>observer</em> or Strategy&#39;s <em>strategy</em>). The difference between\nthe two patterns is the purpose and use case. The <em>Strategy</em> pattern\nrelies on the <em>strategy</em> to do the work, while the <em>Observer</em> pattern\ninforms the <em>observers</em> of what is going on with the <em>subject</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoyed this short example, thanks for reading!</p>\n","summary":"NSA Edition: Exploring design patterns and their use cases","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design-patterns","ruby"],"date":"2013-08-20T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2013/08/05/testing-context-validations","title":"Testing Context Validations","dockyarder":"dan-mcclain","body":"<h2>Quick Refresher on ContextValidation</h2>\n\n<p>A few months ago, Brian released the <a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/ruby/2013/05/09/context-validations.html\">ContextValidations gem</a>.\nContextValidations moves your model validations to the controller,\nallowing you to vary your validations by context, rather than relying on\nconditional validations.</p>\n\n<h2>Let&#39;s validate our user</h2>\n\n<p>We have a user model, that requires a password and a username when a\nuser signs up.

Things on top of things? Easy. Things by themselves? Piece of cake. This thing next to that thing? Things just got complicated.</p>\n\n<p>Should you roll your own layout, coming up with and refining conventions, browser testing to make sure everything still works? Do you rely on a front-end framework and all of the cluttered, confusing markup that comes going from that route? </p>\n\n<p>What about something different? This is where Susy saves the day.</p>\n\n<h2>The little framework that can</h2>\n\n<p>Susy is a grid framework for Compass. With Susy, you simply define your grid settings and start laying things out. If you want to come back and adjust your grid later, that&#39;s totally fine. Susy will recalculate all your layouts.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight css \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"error\">$</span><span class=\"tag\">total-columns</span>: <span class=\"float\">12</span>\n<span class=\"error\">$</span><span class=\"tag\">column-width</span>: <span class=\"float\">4em</span>\n<span class=\"error\">$</span><span class=\"tag\">gutter-width</span>: <span class=\"float\">1em</span>\n<span class=\"error\">$</span><span class=\"tag\">grid-padding</span>: <span class=\"error\">$</span><span class=\"tag\">gutter-width</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Two main mixins do the bulk of the lifting. These are &#39;container&#39; and &#39;span-columns&#39;. Container is used to define the container of the grid. Span-columns is applied to elements within a container context. The syntax is easy.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight css \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"class\">.page</span>\n  +<span class=\"tag\">container</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">article</span>\n    +<span class=\"error\">s</span><span class=\"error\">p</span><span class=\"error\">a</span><span class=\"error\">n</span><span class=\"error\">-</span><span class=\"error\">c</span><span class=\"error\">o</span><span class=\"error\">l</span><span class=\"error\">u</span><span class=\"error\">m</span><span class=\"error\">n</span><span class=\"error\">s</span>(<span class=\"float\">8</span>, <span class=\"float\">12</span>)\n  <span class=\"tag\">aside</span>\n    +<span class=\"error\">s</span><span class=\"error\">p</span><span class=\"error\">a</span><span class=\"error\">n</span><span class=\"error\">-</span><span class=\"error\">c</span><span class=\"error\">o</span><span class=\"error\">l</span><span class=\"error\">u</span><span class=\"error\">m</span><span class=\"error\">n</span><span class=\"error\">s</span>(<span class=\"float\">4</span> <span class=\"tag\">omega</span>, <span class=\"float\">12</span>)\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>This makes &#39;.page&#39; the grid container.

Susy doesn&#39;t care. They are within the context of the article. Susy will figure out the math and make seven columns. The third option is the column padding. Susy will do the math there too. Thanks, Susy!</p>\n\n<h2>Susy, breakpoints and you</h2>\n\n<p>Susy is made to build responsive grids. The default layout is called &#39;magic&#39;. It&#39;s a fixed width layout that fluidly scales if the viewport is smaller than the width of the grid. You can also opt for a fully fluid layout, or a static layout for pixel precision.</p>\n\n<p>Any of these layouts can be further modified with the +at-breakpoint mixin. This mixin makes accessing media queries within the context of our grid simple and straightforward.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight css \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"class\">.one</span>, <span class=\"class\">.two</span>\n  +<span class=\"error\">a</span><span class=\"error\">t</span><span class=\"error\">-</span><span class=\"error\">b</span><span class=\"error\">r</span><span class=\"error\">e</span><span class=\"error\">a</span><span class=\"error\">k</span><span class=\"error\">p</span><span class=\"error\">o</span><span class=\"error\">i</span><span class=\"error\">n</span><span class=\"error\">t</span>(<span class=\"float\">30em</span>)\n    +<span class=\"error\">s</span><span class=\"error\">p</span><span class=\"error\">a</span><span class=\"error\">n</span><span class=\"error\">-</span><span class=\"error\">c</span><span class=\"error\">o</span><span class=\"error\">l</span><span class=\"error\">u</span><span class=\"error\">m</span><span class=\"error\">n</span><span class=\"error\">s</span>(<span class=\"float\">7</span>, <span class=\"float\">7</span>, <span class=\"class\">.5em</span>)\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h2>\u0010The one true grid</h2>\n\n<p>Everything Susy does is within context of a grid. You can  define multiple grids, and nest these grids inside one another. You can define abritrary values within any context. Many useful features, such as push, pull, and bleed are there to make life even easier.</p>\n\n<p>With all of this power comes some responsiblity. As with any tool, Susy just does what you ask it to do. It cannot explain  why your layout isn&#39;t working. If you try to put too many things inside a grid, your layout will break. I&#39;d recommend taking Susy for a spin.

It&#39;s important that all strategy objects\nhave the same responsiblity and support the same interface, which in our case\nwas <code>grill.grilling</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>Grill</code> class is our <em>context</em> class, the operator of the\n<em>strategies</em>, which uses the <code>HotDog#type</code>, <code>Hamburger#type</code>, and\n<code>VeggiePatty#type</code> interchangeably.</p>\n\n<p>Through our contrived example, we see the immediate benefits of this\ndesign pattern:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Separation of concerns</em></li>\n<li><em>Strategies</em> at runtime</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve achieved <em>separation of concerns</em> by designating the <code>#type</code>\nmethod as our desired set of <em>strategies</em>. <code>HotDog</code>, <code>Hamburger</code> and\n<code>VeggiePatty</code>  are unaware of our implementation of <code>Grill#grilling</code>.</p>\n\n<p>As for runtime flexibility, we&#39;re able to switch out the items up on the\ngrill.</p>\n\n<h3>Special Patties: Lambdas</h3>\n\n<p>As we&#39;re grilling our hamburger and veggies patties, a last minute guest\narrives, and she has brought some bacon, jalape\u00f1os, and onions.\nLet&#39;s make some custom patties, but avoid creating more subclasses of\n<code>Food</code>. What could we do here?</p>\n\n<p>A quick and awesome solution would be to use <em>lambdas</em>!</p>\n\n<p>Since we expect our <em>strategies</em> to return <code>Strings</code> for food <code>#type</code>,\nwe can create a <em>lambda</em> which will behave just like the other strategy\nobjects and return a <code>String</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"constant\">CUSTOMPATTY</span> = lambda { |type| <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">#{</span>type<span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}</span></span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span> }\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Next, let&#39;s get back to our <code>Grill</code> class and alter the class a little\nbit.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n<strong>20</strong>\n21\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"class\">Grill</span>\n  attr_accessor <span class=\"symbol\">:food</span>\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">initialize</span> food\n    <span class=\"instance-variable\">@food</span> = food\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">grilling</span>\n    <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">Grilling the </span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">#{</span>print_food<span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}</span></span><span class=\"content\">!</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n\n  private\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">print_food</span>\n    food_is_string? ? food : food.type\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">food_is_string?</span>\n    food.is_a? <span class=\"constant\">String</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Since we know the <em>strategies</em> are <code>Strings</code>, we&#39;ve created two\n<code>private</code> methods, <code>#print_food</code> and <code>#food_is_string</code>.\n<code>#food_is_string</code> will check if <code>Grill</code> has received a\n<code>String</code> or not, and <code>#print_food</code> will handle <em>lambdas</em> or <em>classes</em> of\nfood.</p>\n\n<p>Now let&#39;s try grilling some hot dogs and custom patties!</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>jalape\u00f1os = <span class=\"constant\">CUSTOMPATTY</span>.call <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">spicy jalape\u00f1os patties</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\nbacon = <span class=\"constant\">CUSTOMPATTY</span>.call <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">greasy, yummy bacon patties</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\n\ngrill = <span class=\"constant\">Grill</span>.new jalape\u00f1os\ngrill.grilling <span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; &quot;Grilling the spicy jalape\u00f1os patties!&quot;</span>\n\ngrill.food = bacon\ngrill.grilling <span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; &quot;Grilling the greasy, yummy bacon patties!&quot;</span>\n\ngrill.food = <span class=\"constant\">HotDog</span>.new\ngrill.grilling <span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; &quot;Grilling the hot dogs!&quot;</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Mmm-mmmm... That is a tasty burger.</h3>\n\n<p>The <em>Strategy</em> pattern is a delagation-based design pattern, and shares\nsome similarities with the <em>Template Method</em> pattern. However, instead\nof depending so heavily on inheiritance between a superclass and\nsubclasses to use our target algorithm, we take our algorithm and\nconsider it as a separate object.

A couple of ideas run through our heads.

I was welcomed by a comfortable learning environment and an\natmosphere of positivity and productivity. My coworkers are very\napproachable and always willing to answer my questions. Because of\nDockYard&#39;s intimate size I am able to see all sides of the business, and\nget to know everyone in the office.</p>\n\n<p>It has now been a month since I began working and already I feel I am\nlight-years ahead of where I started. My nerves have been replaced by an\neagerness to continue learning and grow as a developer. The amount of\ninformation that has been thrown my way is rather overwhelming.

Not to mention my introduction to vim and all the commands\nthat accompany it. While I cannot claim all of the information has\nstuck, the exposure will surely breed understanding. I have learned that\nit isn&#39;t about having all the answers, but the efficiency of finding\nthem that is important.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to all the reading, I have worked on a small side project: a\nsimple blog site (my introduction to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\">test-driven\ndevelopment</a>) that I\nrebuilt 3 times, each time adding more features.

Also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming\">pair programming</a> with others in the office has also\nbeen extremely helpful, giving me an idea of the day-to-day.

I, along with Amanda,\nDoug and Chris, attended the training.</p>\n\n<h2>Format</h2>\n\n<p>Throughout the training, attendees were building a simplified Rdio/Spotify clone\nusing Ember. It was broken up into a series of exercises, which built\nupon each other. The exercises were test driven, each having set of QUnit tests that defined the\nexercise. Before each exercise, Tom and Yehuda would explain and demo\nthe concepts via slides and JSBin.</p>\n\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\n\n<p>Day 1 was spent outlining the core concepts of\n<a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com\">Handlebars</a> and Ember. We\nstarted with Handlebars, which is what Ember uses as its templating\nlanguage. After covering the basics of Handlebars, we learned about how\n<a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/\">Ember handles routing and outlets</a>.\nAfter we finished routing, we moved onto creating Handlebars helper\nfunctions.</p>\n\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\n\n<p>On day 2, we started off with\n<a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/controllers/\">Ember controllers</a> and how they\nserve as proxy objects for the model of your current resource. After\ncontrollers, we covered\n<a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/computed-properties/\">computed properties</a>.\n<a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/views/\">Views</a> followed computed properties,\nthen we wrapped up the day with creating custom controls with Ember and\nHandlebars.</p>\n\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\n\n<p>Once we had built the majority of the app, we had a couple more\nexercises that built upon all the exercise we had completed. Tom and\nYehuda also went over how we would use\n<a href=\"http://eviltrout.com/2013/03/23/ember-without-data.html\">Ajax requests to pull in data from a remote source with Promises</a>.\nAfter wrapping up the remainder of the exercises, we covered how the\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13597869/what-is-ember-runloop-and-how-does-it-work\">Ember Run Loop works</a>,\nand discussed approaches to testing Ember applications.</p>\n\n<h2>Feedback</h2>\n\n<p>Yehuda and Tom provided a great balance of not-to-dense information,\nuseful demos and exercises. They did a great job of, what Tom stated as,\n&quot;Providing a sufficient level of confusion&quot; in the exercises. Before\neach exercise, they would provide all the information needed for the\nexercise, but would not give you a list of steps to complete the task.\nYou may struggle a bit, but they answer any questions you would\nhave during the exercise. This would help the attendees actually learn\nthe concepts, rather than just copy/paste a set of code and modify it\nhere and there and have it work. I, personally, felt that this worked\nreally well.</p>\n\n<p>I have worked on a couple side project with Ember before taking this\ntraining, and had a very shallow understanding of some of the concepts.\nComing out of this training, I feel I have a great place to start building\nEmber apps. I really fleshed out my understanding of Ember and am really\nexcited about the technology. I am planning on using it for\nany upcoming side projects, to really explore it further. </p>\n","summary":"We sent a group of developers to the Ember.js training that Tilde taught at Bocoup Loft","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ember","training"],"date":"2013-05-09T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"ruby/2013/05/09/context-validations","title":"Context Validations","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>I just released a new <a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/context_validations\">gem called ContextValidations</a></p>\n\n<p>ContextValidations allows you to set validations on the instance of\nActiveRecord models. Any class-level validations you have already set\nin your models are ignored. You may be asking yourself &quot;Whaaaaaat?&quot; so\nlet&#39;s look into why.</p>\n\n<h2>Conditional Validations Are A Smell</h2>\n\n<p>When applications grow in complexity the validation models required to\nsupport them usually grow too. Eventually you will have to &quot;work around&quot;\nthe validations with conditionals that rely upon state flags. In some\ncases you end up writing empty model objects for use with your forms to\navoid the mess that conditional validations introduce.</p>\n\n<p>The problem here is that the model is defining a single set of\nvalidations but the model needs to absorb different sets of data under\ndifferent circumstances. Imagine you have a user account that where\ndepending upon how the users get to your app will depend upon what data\nthey need to provide. You might also be importing data from an external\nincomplete data set. Do you set these records aside into another table\nuntil the records are claimed and the user can complete registration? Or\ndo you allow the records to save and have the model enter a state of\n<code>unclaimed</code> to avoid authentication until <code>claimed</code>? You could just\navoid the validations all together but you definitely don&#39;t want to\nallow records that don&#39;t have the most basic of identifying information\nsuch as <code>email</code> or <code>username</code> to be saved.</p>\n\n<p>You can imagine with this scenario the current solution with Rails is\neither a very complex and messy validation model or breaking things out\ninto other models and having a strategy to reconciling that at a later\npoint in time.</p>\n\n<h2>Context Matters</h2>\n\n<p>I have come to believe that defining a monolithic validation set in your\nmodel is the wrong way to go. Context matters. If I am an admin I should\nbe able to write data to a record that might not be acceptable to a\nregular user. Even the simple case of not requiring a password unless\nthe record is new.</p>\n\n<h3>Controllers Are the Context</h3>\n\n<p>I believe the rule of &quot;Fat Model, Skinny Controller&quot; has conditioned\nRails developers to never ever put anything more than a few lines of\ncode into your controllers. For the most part this is a good trend. But\nas we have seen with <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/strong_parameters\">Strong Parameters</a> \nthere are circumstances where adding a few more lines to our controllers\nisn&#39;t going to end the world. I submit the case is also true for\nvalidations. The controller is the context in which the user is\ninteracting with the data. Going back to the admin example, you most\nlikely have a <code>UsersController</code> and an <code>Admin::UsersController</code> defined.\nTwo controllers, same data. Different contexts. Not only should you\nallow mass assignment to the models differently for each context but\nwhat is considered &quot;valid data&quot; should also be different.</p>\n\n<h2>Context Validations</h2>\n\n<p>To handle this need I have just released\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/context_validations\">ContextValidations</a>.\nThe goals of this gem are simple:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Maintain simplicity</li>\n<li>Enable instance level validations</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t deviate from exisitng Rails validations</li>\n<li>Backwards compatibility with 3rd party libraries</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Before I dive into each one let&#39;s see how a set of validations might be\napplied in a controller</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n<strong>20</strong>\n21\n22\n23\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"class\">UsersController</span> &lt; <span class=\"constant\">ApplicationController</span>\n  include <span class=\"constant\">ContextValidations</span>::<span class=\"constant\">Controller</span>\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">create</span>\n    <span class=\"instance-variable\">@user</span> = <span class=\"constant\">User</span>.new(user_params)\n    <span class=\"instance-variable\">@user</span>.validations = validations(<span class=\"symbol\">:create</span>)\n    <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"instance-variable\">@user</span>.save\n      <span class=\"comment\"># happy path</span>\n    <span class=\"keyword\">else</span>\n      <span class=\"comment\"># sad path</span>\n    <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">base_validations</span>\n    validates <span class=\"symbol\">:first_name</span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:last_name</span> <span class=\"symbol\">:email</span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:presence</span> =&gt; <span class=\"predefined-constant\">true</span>\n    validates <span class=\"symbol\">:email</span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:uniqueness</span> =&gt; <span class=\"predefined-constant\">true</span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:format</span> =&gt; <span class=\"constant\">EmailFormat</span>\n    validates <span class=\"symbol\">:password</span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:confirmation</span> =&gt; <span class=\"predefined-constant\">true</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">create_validations</span>\n    validates <span class=\"symbol\">:password</span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:presence</span> =&gt; <span class=\"predefined-constant\">true</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Maintain Simplicity</h3>\n\n<p>At this point some of you are probably thinking <a href=\"http://rhnh.net/2012/12/03/form-objects-in-rails\">Form Objects</a>.\nPerhaps in the end, Form Objects will be the real answer for what I\nstrive for. But right now I don&#39;t see a justification for the increase\nin complexity. <code>ContextValidations</code> has attempted to keep the complexity\nas low as possible while still allowing for flexibility. The\n<code>ContextValidations::Controller</code> module can be mixed into any object,\nnot just controllers. Let&#39;s say you had a <a href=\"http://stevelorek.com/service-objects.html\">Service Object</a></p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"class\">UserService</span>\n  include <span class=\"constant\">ContextValidations</span>::<span class=\"constant\">Controller</span>\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">initialize</span>(params)\n    <span class=\"instance-variable\">@params</span> = params\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">create</span>\n    <span class=\"instance-variable\">@user</span> = <span class=\"constant\">User</span>.new(create_params)\n    <span class=\"instance-variable\">@user</span> = validations(<span class=\"symbol\">:create</span>)\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>At this point the code looks identitly to the controller example from\nabove. The validations are accessible anywhere, from any object.</p>\n\n<h3>Instance level validations</h3>\n\n<p>The real key here is that the instance of the model is able to declare\nwhat its validations are rather than the class. To that end you must\nmixin the <code>ContextValidations::Model</code> module into any model you want to\nuse <code>ContextValidations</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"class\">User</span> &lt; <span class=\"constant\">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class=\"constant\">Base</span>\n  include <span class=\"constant\">ContextValidations</span>::<span class=\"constant\">Model</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>This mixin will do several things to you <code>ActiveRecord</code> model</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>A <code>#validations</code> setter and getter is added. The default for\n<code>#validations</code> is an empty array. When any arrays are assigned they are\nwrapped in an array and falttened out.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <code>:validate</code> callbacks are completed removed. This allows the\nmodel to accept validations set on the class by 3rd party libraries but\nthese validations will never run.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <code>#run_validations!</code> protected method is overwritten to run\nthrough the instance level validations instead of running the\n<code>:validate</code> callback.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Don&#39;t deviate from exisitng Rails validations</h3>\n\n<p>The only difference from writing your validations now is they are\nwritten on the instance. The <code>#validates</code> method functions exactly the\nsame way. You can still pass conditional validations if you&#39;d like but I\nwouldn&#39;t recommend it.</p>\n\n<h3>Backwards compatibility with 3rd party libraries</h3>\n\n<p>As mentioned above we don&#39;t want your Rails app to crash if 3rd party\nlibraries are declaring regular Rails validations in your models. They\nare just ignored.</p>\n\n<h2>Moving forward</h2>\n\n<p>There are a few directions things could move in. I still haven&#39;t come\nup with a simple way to test <code>ContextValidations</code>. There will also be\nvalidations that are always used regardless of the context. I don&#39;t\nthink it makes sense to constantly rewrite these validations. One\npossibility would be to consider the class validations the\n<code>base_validations</code> that are always run then you can declare context\nvalidations on the instance. This might cause issues with 3rd party\nlibraries that are using conditional validations. But, we could easily\nget around that by ignoring any class level validations that have\nconditionals on them.</p>\n\n<p>I am eager to get feedback on this. I am sure this might cause some\nfriction as it moves outside of the comfort zone for many Rails devs but\nnow I am happy with the direction.</p>\n","summary":"An alternative to the normal Rails validations","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ruby","ruby-on-rails","gems"],"date":"2013-05-09T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"design/2013/04/26/thoughts-on-designing-responsive-websites","title":"Thoughts on Designing Responsive Websites","dockyarder":"amanda-cheung","body":"<p>Things I have learned about the design process of making responsive websites:</p>\n\n<h4>Design Mobile First</h4>\n\n<p>Why do I like to design for narrower screen sizes first? Because it places emphasis on hierarchy and content organization. It prioritizes making decisions about organizing the content of the site, which of course is the most important part! (Take a look at some of <a href=\"http://karenmcgrane.com/category/content-strategy/\">Karen McGrane&#39;s stuff</a> if you want to read more about content strategy) Which sections make the most sense near each other? Does the layout order make it easy for a user to find what she or he is looking for? Imagine how disjointed it could be for a mobile user if the content groupings didn&#39;t flow in context among each other. Figuring all this out before moving on to designing wider screen sizes can be very helpful. Everything can&#39;t be shoved <a href=\"http://iampaddy.com/lifebelow600/\">&quot;above the fold&quot;</a> in mobile. Say goodbye to hearing that everything is important!</p>\n\n<h4>Don&#39;t Fight the Web, Work With It!</h4>\n\n<p>Think ahead about how design elements are going to be implemented during initial design stages. Can it be written out of CSS? Maybe some elements can&#39;t be, but let&#39;s keep those to a minimal. With all the fancy CSS3 things we can do now, we shouldn&#39;t have to open up Photoshop to make design edits. In the way that form should follow function, allow implementation to inform design. This is not an argument against <a href=\"http://sachagreif.com/flat-pixels/\">skeuomorphism</a>, but it just so happens that flatter designs tend to be more web-friendly. Sorry, pirate scrolls. Not sorry.</p>\n\n<h4>Get in the Browser ASAP</h4>\n\n<p>After laying out a few basic wireframes, I like to jump right into HTML and CSS (or really, <a href=\"http://haml.info/\">HAML</a> and <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">SASS</a>). Whether you start on paper, Illustrator, or Photoshop, the design won&#39;t look like how it&#39;s really going to look until it&#39;s in the browser. It makes more sense for me to get right in to iterations while seeing how layouts are behaving at different screen sizes. I find myself doing a lot of trial and error because I can never be sure of what may or may not work. If I think of a possible solution, I try it out. If it doesn&#39;t work better than what I had, I&#39;ll revert it and try something else. The majority of my designing and problem-solving happens in the browser now where I can shrink and expand the width of the window to see how everything is coming together. For me, getting right into this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_design\">iterative design</a> process beats out creating thorough mockups that will only represent so little of the &quot;final product&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a lot of stuff to know so the best way to learn is to dive right in!</p>\n","summary":"What I've learned by making a few responsive websites - Part 1","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["design"],"date":"2013-04-26T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"ruby/2013/04/04/we-are-hiring-for-an-emberjs-dev","title":"We are hiring for a fulltime Ember.js developer","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>We are looking for an Ember.js Developer.

We first stop the current user by calling\n<code>sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql stop</code>. We also want to copy the current <code>pg_hba.conf</code>, since we can reuse it with PostgreSQL 9.2 to disable the need\nfor a password for the <code>postgres</code> role. We then remove the currently installed version via <code>sudo apt-get remove postgresql postgresql-9.1 -qq --purge</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Add the apt.postgresql.org repositories</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://postgresql.org\">Postgresql.org</a> maintains Debian and Ubuntu packages of the current PostgreSQL 8.3, 8.4, 9.0, 9.1 and 9.2 builds at\n<a href=\"http://apt.postgresql.org\">apt.postgresql.org</a> (<a href=\"https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt\">more\ninformation</a>). Since Travis-CI\nworkers run Ubuntu, we can leverage these packages. We first load the\nUbuntu distribution environment variables via <code>source /etc/lsb-release</code>.\nUsing the <code>$DISTRIB_CODENAME</code> variable, we can set up the pgdg.list file\nthat we will add to the apt-get sources list directory. We do so with\nthe following command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight text \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>echo &quot;deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $DISTRIB_CODENAME-pgdg main&quot; &gt; pgdg.list\nsudo mv pgdg.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>The last thing we have to do before we can start installing the 9.2 is\nto import postgresql.org&#39;s apt key via</p>\n<div class=\"highlight text \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>wget --quiet -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>In with the new</h3>\n\n<p>After we update our package listing via <code>sudo apt-get update</code>, we can\ninstall <code>postgresql-9.2</code> and <code>postgresql-contrib-9.2</code> (needed for the\nPostgreSQL extensions) via:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight text \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>sudo apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::=&quot;--force-confdef&quot; -o Dpkg::Options::=&quot;--force-confnew&quot; install postgresql-9.2 postgresql-contrib-9.2 -qq\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>We need the <code>Dpkg::Options</code> to automatically resolve any configuration\nfile conflicts left behind by 9.1 (even though we purge the files, for\nsome reason the <code>/etc/init.d/postgresql</code> file gets left behind). Without\nthe <code>Dpkg::Options</code>, apt-get will raise a user prompt that will hang the\nTravis-CI build.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, we have a vanilla install of PostgreSQL 9.2, which will\nprompt for a password for the <code>postgres</code> role. We then need to stop the\nserver, replace the 9.2 <code>pg_hba.conf</code> with the custom Travis-CI one we\ncopied earlier, then restart the server:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight text \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql stop\nsudo cp ./pg_hba.conf /etc/postgresql/9.2/main\nsudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>At this point, you can use any other <code>before_script</code> commands you were\npreviously using to create your database.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>After a decent amount of trial and error, I arrived at the above\n<code>before_script</code> to install PostgreSQL 9.2. I am currently adding support\nfor <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/rangetypes.html\">ranges</a>\nto postgres<em>ext, which was added in 9.2. You should be able use this\n`before</em>script` to add 9.2 to your Travis-CI builds.</p>\n","summary":"Test your gem against the latest PostgreSQL version (or an older one)","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ruby","postgresql"],"date":"2013-03-29T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"ember/2013/03/27/body-class-tags-in-ember","title":"Adding route specific body class tags in Ember","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>Our <a href=\"http://twitter.com/cssboy\">designer</a> likes to use body class tags\ndepending upon the context of the app he is designing.

I am a big fan of Heroku and I felt something missing from their\neco-system was an App Store. Similar to the WordPress Theme Store. This\nHeroku App Store would allow developers to create fully realized\napplications and sell them to non developers. The person on the\npurchasing side wouldn&#39;t even need to know about Heroku. We built this\nproduct over the past year, got the &quot;thumbs up&quot; from Heroku, finally got bored with the idea of launching it, and\nare now open sourcing it for all to see. I will go into the challenges we\nfaced as a consulting firm building a product and why we decided to give\nthis away rather than &quot;go for it&quot;.</p>\n\n<h2>Concept to reality</h2>\n\n<p>The concept was simple: App Store for Heroku. I built the original app\ncode in May of 2012. I would say about 50% of the app was completed in a\nweek. However, what I quickly learned is that balancing consulting a\nproduct development is not easy. Quickly development on Igata turned\ninto a see-saw. A day of work here and there in between contracts. It\nbecame very difficult to stay focused and keep interested in the\nproject. But I believed it was one that could do well if positioned\nproperly. The idea of proving an additional revenue stream to Heroku\nalso felt like a good challenge.</p>\n\n<p>I let the app sit for a few months while we were working on a very large\ncontract over the summer. Then the Rails Rumble came and I was a judge,\nI saw an app called <a href=\"https://deploybutton.com\">Deploy Button</a> and I\nfreaked out. This was essentially what we had already built but without\nthe purchasing aspect. I emailed my team and told them we weren&#39;t taking\nany more contracts until we finished Igata. This proved to not work very\nwell in reality. As a Rails consultancy we are not cheap but you don&#39;t\nrealize just how expensive you are until there is no money coming in. So\nwe went back on contract and shelved Igata, again. I kept coming back to\nit every so often. Finally I decided to open source it.</p>\n\n<h2>Validation</h2>\n\n<p>It wasn&#39;t until I made the decision to open source Igata that I started\nto get some validation of the concept. I was very secretive about the\napp as I figured if Heroku found out about it, and liked the idea, they\nwould just toss a few devs at it for a week or two and come out with an\n&quot;official&quot; app store. But now that I was going to OSS is fuck it, I&#39;ll\ntell everybody! I told a few friends that work at Heroku and in the end\nit was foolish of me to worry about that sort of thing. Several people\nencouraged me not to open source and just finish and release. So I went\nto Waza (Heroku&#39;s Conference) and met with a few people from Heroku&#39;s\nPartner program, once I showed them the app they loved it.</p>\n\n<p>I came home a few weeks ago, pumped to finish the app.</p>\n\n<h2>Back to Open Sourcing</h2>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t say doubt began to creep back in, just more that I really\ndidn&#39;t like the idea of what would come of Heroku if it it was a\nsuccess. Maintaining an app store and building it out really doesn&#39;t\ninterest me at all. I had a choice: shit or get off the pot. I&#39;ve now\ndecided to get off the pot.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m happy to go into more details on what our business model would have\nbeen in another post if people are interested. The app itself is about\n95% complete. There were some changes to the payment system we would\nmake. But overall I&#39;m happy with what we built considering the very\ndisrupted development schedule on it. I hope this app can serve someone\nwell.</p>\n","summary":"We built an App Store for Heroku, got bored with it, and now open sourced it","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ruby","products","business"],"date":"2013-03-25T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"ember/2013/03/21/capybara-and-unique-labels","title":"Fixing Capybara 2.0 and Labels","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>I love Capybara, it makes integration testing a breeze. However, one of\nthe decisions made for Capybara 2.0 confuses an annoys me. In Capybara\n1.x you could do the following:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>fill_in <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Password</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:with</span> =&gt; <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">123456</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\nfill_in <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Password confirmation</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:with</span> =&gt; <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">123456</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>And everything worked. In Capybara 2.0 this does not work. Capybara will\nnotice two labels that contain &#39;Password&#39; and complain about an\nambiguous locator. The suggested work around is to attach meta data to\nthe input element and use that for the selector. There are two reasons\nwhy I don&#39;t like this. First, I am doing Ember development now and I\nhave no control of the ID, it is generated by the framework. Second, I\nbelieve that the integration test should be recreating the steps (as\nmuch as possible) as if a user were actually using the app. Something\nlike:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>fill_in <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">[data-name=&quot;password&quot;]</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:with</span> =&gt; <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">123456</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\nfill_in <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">[data-name=&quot;password_confirmation&quot;]</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:with</span> =&gt; <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">123456</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Doesn&#39;t sit right with me. Users are looking at the text, not the selectors.\nI get that apps have the ability to show different languages but that doesn&#39;t conern me, I don&#39;t need\nto test if the Rails <code>i18n</code> works or not. I just care about asserting the happy and sad\npaths in my app.</p>\n\n<p>So, to fix this problem simply add the\nfollowing code into your <code>test_helper.rb</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">module</span> <span class=\"class\">XPath::HTML</span>\n  protected\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">locate_field</span>(xpath, locator)\n    locate_field = xpath[attr(<span class=\"symbol\">:id</span>).equals(locator) | attr(<span class=\"symbol\">:name</span>).equals(locator) | attr(<span class=\"symbol\">:placeholder</span>).equals(locator) | attr(<span class=\"symbol\">:id</span>).equals(anywhere(<span class=\"symbol\">:label</span>)[string.n.equals(locator)].attr(<span class=\"symbol\">:for</span>))]\n    locate_field += descendant(<span class=\"symbol\">:label</span>)[string.n.contains(locator)].descendant(xpath)\n    locate_field[~attr(<span class=\"symbol\">:disabled</span>)]\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>And you should be all set!</p>\n","summary":"Capybara is broken, they refused to fix.

this is just a very simple form, but what if we could write this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight handlebars \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td

more concise! We pass the <code>controller</code> as the context to\nthe <code>formFor</code> Handlebars helper. Then we can simply call <code>input</code> for\neach property we want.</p>\n\n<p>By default <code>EasyForm</code> will use text fields for the rendered input.\nHowever, in certain cases it will attempt to properly set the <code>type</code>. If\nthe property contains <code>email</code> the <code>type</code> will be set to <code>email</code> or of\nthe property contains <code>password</code> the <code>type</code> will be set to <code>password</code>.\nYou can override this and set the type yourself:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight handlebars \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">input</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">code</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">type</span>=<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">hidden</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Currently the only other input type supported is <code>textarea</code>, you can\ncreate one with:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight handlebars \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">input</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">bio</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">as</span>=<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">text</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>I plan on adding support for the other input types such as <code>select</code> in\nthe next few weeks.</p>\n\n<h2>Validations</h2>\n\n<p>This implementation has basic support for property validations.\nCurrently it works with <code>ember-data-validations</code> but that project might\nget rolled into a larger Ember Object Validation effort and at that time\nI will change <code>ember-easyForm</code> to support whatever that is.</p>\n\n<p>Validations will fire on <code>onFocusOut</code> for each input and will render\ninto a <code>&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;</code> element associated with the given input.</p>\n\n<p>If your model doesn&#39;t have validations this behavior will be ignored.</p>\n\n<h2>Form Submit</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>submit</code> helper will render a submit input but you can just write\none yourself if you wish. The <code>onSubmit</code> action for the wrapping <code>form</code>\nelement will do the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Attempt to validate for object. If validations are not supported it\nwill go to step 3.</li>\n<li>If validations fail form submit is interrupted and errors are\nrendered. If not go to step 3.</li>\n<li>The view for the <code>form</code> element will attempt to call a <code>submit</code>\naction on the controller. This is an action that you need to supply\nyourself:</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"highlight javascript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>App.NewUserController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n  <span class=\"function\">submit</span>: <span class=\"keyword\">function</span>() {\n    <span class=\"comment\">// handle form submit here</span>\n  }\n});\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<h2>More to come!</h2>\n\n<p>This is very close to what I recently (and briefly) showed at\n<a href=\"http://www.embercamp.com\">EmberCamp</a>\nlast week.

Let&#39;s break down each:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>save</code> will make a call to <code>this.store.commit()</code>. You will notice we are not modifying a model, assigning params, etc... as you would in a Rails app. Keep in mind that when you modify data that is bound in the form you are actually modifying the data in the model itself. The datastore in Ember needs to be directed when these modifications should be made &quot;permanent&quot;, and because we are using the RESTAdapter Ember will attempt to write these changes to the backend.</li>\n<li><code>cancel</code> If the user decides to not create a new user we must delete the record we created then transition to the <code>index</code> page.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/models/model-lifecycle\">Learn more about the Ember Model Lifecycle</a></p>\n\n<p>Finally we&#39;re going to hook up the back end in <code>app/controllers/users_controller.rb</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">create</span>\n  user = <span class=\"constant\">User</span>.new(params[<span class=\"symbol\">:user</span>])\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> user.save\n    render <span class=\"key\">json</span>: user\n  <span class=\"keyword\">else</span>\n    render <span class=\"key\">json</span>: user, <span class=\"key\">status</span>: <span class=\"integer\">422</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>It has been mentioned that <code>422</code> is the proper status code for validation failures. Personally I would prefer to use <code>respond_with</code> but it isn&#39;t part of the default Rails-API stack, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rails-api-core/QhPh2VG7yTU\">hopefully this will change</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now let&#39;s run our app and see how it goes.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/kFC9arb.png\" alt=\"New1\"></p>\n\n<p>Whoops, we have <code>undefined undefined</code> for the <code>fullName</code>. Let&#39;s set default values of an empty string in our user model:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight coffeescript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>App.User = DS.Model.extend\n  firstName: DS.attr('string', defaultValue: '' )\n  lastName: DS.attr('string', defaultValue: '' )\n  quote: DS.attr('string')\n  fullName: (-&gt;\n    &quot;#{@get('firstName')} #{@get('lastName')}&quot;\n  ).property('firstName', 'lastName')\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now when we add data and create it will write to the back end, take us to the show page. When can then click <code>Back</code> and we can see the record has been automatically added to the collection on the <code>index</code> page.</p>\n\n<p>Adding <code>Edit</code> should be straight forward now that we have done create. Start will adding the route:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight coffeescript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td

need to edit the two controllers.

This allows us to treat the templates similar to a partial in Rails.</p>\n\n<p>Finally we&#39;re going to add the ability to delete records.

Ember looks for templates in the <code>Ember.TEMPLATES</code> JavaScript object which is provided to us with the <code>handlebars_assets</code> gem we setup in Part 1. We just need to tell the gem to compile for Ember. We can do this in <code>config/initializers/handlebars_assets.rb</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td

href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/templates/handlebars-basics\">Read more about Ember Templates</a></p>\n\n<p>This is the Ember equivalent of a Rails layout template. The <code>outlet</code> is the Ember equivalent to <code>yield</code> in Rails. So this template will wrap the other templates we plan on rendering. I will come back to the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s in the nav later.</p>\n\n<p>Next we&#39;re going to setup a default route and render a template. In <code>app/assets/javascripts/routes.coffee</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight coffeescript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>App.Router.reopen\n  location: 'history'\n  rootURL: '/'\n\nApp.Router.map -&gt;\n  @resource 'users'\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/routing\">Read more about Ember Routes</a></p>\n\n<p>This will tell the Ember Router to use the History API instead of the\ndefault &#39;hash&#39; URLs for routes. The mapping of the <code>/</code> in our app is\nimplicit in Ember, and it will be assigned to a route of \n<code>index</code>. The Ember Router will use this string to make some\nassumptions. If there is a <code>App.IndexController</code> object it will use that\ncontroller. If not, it will just render out the <code>index</code> template. Now,\nunder the hood Ember is still using a <code>App.IndexController</code> controller\nbut it will define one on the fly. I will get into this in a future blog\npost. When you call <code>reopen</code> this is the Ember way to reopen and monkey\npatch a class. As you can see the Ember Router syntax is similar to the\none in Rails. This is by design. We need the 2nd route there so our\n<code>application.hbs</code> template can compile as it is referencing the\n<code>users.index</code> route.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s write <code>app/assets/javascripts/templates/index.hbs</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight text \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>&lt;h1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>We need to do one last thing before we check out the homepage. By default, Rails includes a sample <code>index</code> page in <code>public/index.html</code>. If we were to go to the homepage now, we would see that.\nBut we want to see the index page we just made. To remove the Rails default page, simply run</p>\n\n<p><code>rm public/index.html</code></p>\n\n<p>from the command line.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s it. If you run your rails server and load the app you should see the following\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1j50C.png?1\" alt=\"Welcome\"></p>\n\n<p>Congratulations! You&#39;ve built your first Ember app! Let&#39;s make it do\nsomething useful. We are going to add the <code>/users</code> page, so edit\n<code>app/assets/javascripts/templates/users.hbs</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight handlebars \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"tag\">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Users<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"tag\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">span3</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span><span class=\"tag\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">&lt;table</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">table table-striped</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span><span class=\"tag\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"tag\">&lt;tr&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"tag\">&lt;th&gt;</span>ID<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/th&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"tag\">&lt;th&gt;</span>Name<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/th&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"tag\">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">&lt;/table&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Reload your app and you can click back and forth between &#39;Users&#39; and &#39;Home&#39;, thanks to the <code>linkTo</code> actions we setup in <code>application.hbs</code>. These actions map to controllers being automatically generated because we haven&#39;t created them yet; those controllers automatically render the templates with the same naming convention. Does that sound familiar? That&#39;s right, its our good friend <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration\">Convention Over Configuration</a>!</p>\n\n<p>Now, when clicking between the two pages the nav is not properly updating the <code>active</code> class on the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags. In Ember, you can <a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/templates/binding-element-class-names\">bind element class names to actions</a>. This will require a bit of code, but as we add more controllers I&#39;ll show how we can easily reuse what we&#39;re about to write. Let&#39;s start by adding the bindings to <code>application.hbs</code> Modify the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags in the nav menu to:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight handlebars \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"tag\">&lt;li</span> <span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">bindAttr</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">isHome:active</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span><span class=\"tag\">&gt;</span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{#</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">linkTo</span> <span class=\"error\">'</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">index</span><span class=\"error\">'</span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span>Home<span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{/</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">linkTo</span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/li&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"tag\">&lt;li</span> <span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">bindAttr</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">isUsers:active</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span><span class=\"tag\">&gt;</span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{#</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">linkTo</span> <span class=\"error\">'</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">users.index</span><span class=\"error\">'</span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span>Users<span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{/</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">linkTo</span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/li&gt;</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>This binding of <code>isHome:active</code> tells Ember to make the class <code>active</code> if the <code>isHome</code> attribute on the controller is <code>true</code>. If it is <code>false</code> the value will be nothing. The same goes for <code>isUsers</code>. Because this code lives in <code>application.hbs</code> we need to add these attributes to <code>app/assets/javascripts/controllers/applicationController.coffee</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight coffeescript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend\n  isHome: (-&gt;\n    @get('currentRoute') == 'home'\n  ).property('currentRoute')\n\n  isUsers: (-&gt;\n    @get('currentRoute') == 'users'\n  ).property('currentRoute')\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/controllers\">Read more about Ember Controllers</a></p>\n\n<p>Each attribute is a function that will compare the <code>currentRoute</code> attribute to a value and return that boolean result. We instruct the attribute to be a <a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/computed-properties\">computed property</a>. Computed properties are simple to understand: we tell Ember to automatically update the value of &#39;isHome&#39; when <code>currentRoute</code> is <code>set</code> to a different value. Ember will then instruct anything bound to that attribute to update as well.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we&#39;re going to update our routes to set <code>currentRoute</code> depending upon the route. Let&#39;s add two route classes to <code>app/assets/javascripts/routes.coffee</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight coffeescript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>App.IndexRoute = Ember.Route.extend\n  setupController: (controller, model) -&gt;\n    @controllerFor('application').set('currentRoute', 'home')\n\nApp.UsersRoute = Ember.Route.extend\n  setupController: (controller, model) -&gt;\n    @controllerFor('application').set('currentRoute', 'users')\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Two new concepts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>setupController</code> is a function automatically called on each visit to the route. It will pass in an instance of the controller and a model if you supply one (we&#39;ll see this in a bit)</li>\n<li><code>this.controllerFor</code> When interacting with a specific controller you may want to modify a different controller. In this case the wrapping controller is <code>ApplicationController</code> and we need to update the <code>currentRoute</code> attribute. You <em>must</em> use the <code>set</code> function otherwise Ember won&#39;t know to notify any <a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/computed-properties/\">computed property observers</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now reload your app and click between the actions and you should see the active states properly set depending upon your route.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we&#39;re going to start using real data. We&#39;re going to fetch the collection of Users from the server and display them on the index page. Let&#39;s start with telling Ember what our data store looks like in <code>app/assets/javascripts/store.coffee</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight coffeescript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>App.Store = DS.Store.extend()\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/models/the-rest-adapter\">Read more about Ember&#39;s REST Adapter</a></p>\n\n<p>The REST adapter allows us to pull from an API backend assuming certain conventions are followed in the URIs and JSON response. Thankfully we set this up properly in <a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/ember/2013/01/07/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-api-part-1.html\">Part 1</a></p>\n\n<p>Now we&#39;ll create a new model in <code>app/assets/javascripts/models/user.coffee</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight coffeescript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>App.User = DS.Model.extend(\n  firstName: DS.attr('string')\n  lastName:  DS.attr('string')\n  quote:     DS.attr('string')\n  fullName: (-&gt;\n    &quot;#{@get('firstName')} #{@get('lastName')}&quot;\n  ).property('firstName', 'lastName')\n)\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/models\">Read more about Ember models</a></p>\n\n<p>We are defining each attribute that is coming over the wire, as well as a computed property that will combine <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code>. If you&#39;re wondering about that call to <code>property</code>, you have to let Ember know when a method on an object is using a property computed from dependency properties on that object. Here <code>fullName</code> depends on <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code>. When we call <code>property</code> and let Ember know which properties to observe, the <code>fullName</code> property will update if either the <code>firstName</code> or <code>lastName</code> changes. If you like, you can <a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/computed-properties/\">read more about computed properties</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now we need to modify the <code>users</code> route to fetch the data</p>\n<div class=\"highlight coffeescript \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>App.UsersRoute = Ember.Route.extend\n  model: -&gt;\n    App.User.find()\n  setupController: (controller, model) -&gt;\n    @controllerFor('application').set('currentRoute', 'users')\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>The <code>App.User.find()</code> makes a remote call, fetches the collection, and instantiates the models. This collection is then passed to <code>setupController</code> through the <code>model</code> attribute. We then assign this collection to the <code>users</code> attribute on the controller. </p>\n\n<p>Now edit <code>app/assets/javascripts/templates/users.hbs</code> to include a list of our users and an outlet through which we&#39;ll render a users index page and our users show page.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight handlebars \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"tag\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">span3</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span><span class=\"tag\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">&lt;table</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">table table-striped</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span><span class=\"tag\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"tag\">&lt;tr&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"tag\">&lt;th&gt;</span>ID<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/th&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"tag\">&lt;th&gt;</span>Name<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/th&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"tag\">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{#</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">each</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">controller</span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span>\n      <span class=\"tag\">&lt;tr&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"tag\">&lt;td&gt;</span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">id</span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/td&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"tag\">&lt;td&gt;</span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{#</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">linkTo</span> <span class=\"error\">&quot;</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">users.show</span><span class=\"error\">&quot;</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">this</span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">fullName</span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{/</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">linkTo</span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/td&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"tag\">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{/</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">each</span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span>\n  <span class=\"tag\">&lt;/table&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n\n<span class=\"tag\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"attribute-name\">class</span>=<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">span8</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span><span class=\"tag\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">{{</span><span class=\"attribute-name\">outlet</span><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}}</span></span>\n<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>We are linking to the <code>show</code> named route and passing the instance of a <code>User</code> (which is what <code>this</code> refers to) as the paramater.

This article aims to describe some of the varying\napproaches we used to integrate with external systems in a recent\nproject we built for the <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org\">AFL-CIO</a>&#39;s Super PAC\n<a href=\"http://www.workersvoice.org\">Worker&#39;s Voice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For this project, integration with external vendors was the biggest technical hurdle to clear in order to ensure a successful launch.  The project, called <a href=\"http://repurpose.workersvoice.org/\">RePurpose</a>, gives volunteers and activists a way to choose how the movement&#39;s resources get deployed.  The more volunteering and activism a person does, the more RePurpose points they earn, which they can then use to direct the funding of things like more canvassers, direct mail pieces or online ads.  </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a way to give the people on the ground a say in how the money gets spent.</p>\n\n<p>The volunteering and activism data for which RePurpose points get awarded exists in several separate systems:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.ngpvan.com\">VAN</a></p>\n\n<p>VAN is the de facto standard tool used everywhere in progressive politics - from small local races all the way up to the Obama campaign.  It&#39;s an organizing tool that stores volunteer records, canvass records (door knocks and phone calls), activist codes, and other organizing data used by progressive campaigns and organizations.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.salsalabs.com\">Salsa Labs</a></p>\n\n<p>Salsa has a platform with a rich API and tools to create fundraising and advocacy campaigns and manage organizer data.  It stores supporter records, online donation records, and pledges to take action - among other things.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://amicushq.com/\">Amicus</a></p>\n\n<p>Amicus is a new online tool that leverages Facebook connections of volunteers to enhance fundraising and advocacy campaigns.  It stores a set of volunteer records, friend invite records, and social calling records.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal was straightforward - RePurpose needed to know when a volunteer\nwas performing tasks in external systems, so that the user could receive\npoints in RePurpose for those tasks.  RePurpose itself has a Task model\nthat supports multiple kinds of tasks in the various external systems -\nsurvey tasks, activist code tasks, and\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvassing\">canvass</a> tasks in VAN, donation tasks and action tasks in Salsa, and friend invite tasks and call tasks in Amicus.  So a RePurpose administrator could set up a task that would award 10 RePurpose points each time a volunteer knocked on a door, made a phone call, or made a donation.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s how we did it in each system:</p>\n\n<h2>VAN Sync</h2>\n\n<p>VAN, which was recently voted <a href=\"http://rootscamp.neworganizing.com/awards/2012/\">Most Valuable\nTech</a> at <a href=\"http://rootscamp.neworganizing.com/\">RootsCamp\n2012</a>, has a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP\">SOAP</a>-based API that allows us to list survey questions, list activist codes, and create and list volunteers (among other things) - all of which we use to get that data into RePurpose, but the API doesn&#39;t support retrieving the raw canvasser data - which is the piece we really need to award credit.  To get this data the two options were a nightly sync of flat files, or getting direct access to a replicated database.  We opted for the flat file sync as we knew it had worked for other organizations (among them the Democratic National Committee) and the replicated database approach would have incurred extra time, expense, and risk.</p>\n\n<p>We worked with the great folks at VAN to get a nightly data sync into\nplace.  Each night around 3am, VAN uploads a zipped TSV (tab-separated\nvalues) export of the relevant data from all the relevant tables in the\nAFL-CIO&#39;s VAN database.  This is not a delta - because the data size is\nrelatively low (&lt; 1 GB), we receive the full data dump each night.  We\nthen unzip, verify that all the files we expect are present, convert\ncharacter encodings from\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252\">CP1252</a> to\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8\">UTF8</a> (VAN uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server\">MSSQL\nServer</a>), and load\nthis data into auxiliary tables in the RePurpose database using\n<a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org\">PostgreSQL</a>&#39;s\n&quot;<a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-copy.html\">COPY</a>&quot; command.  All told it takes about 5 minutes each night to process, load, and index around 700MB of data from flat files to get it into PostgreSQL and ready to be used.  Then based on the new data we award credit to volunteers for completing tasks.  This approach handles the most data of any of the external integrations and does so reliably.  It has one drawback which is that the data can be at most 24 hours stale by the time we receive it, which is not ideal but is certainly workable.  In practice this has not been a problem for us.</p>\n\n<h2>Salsa API</h2>\n\n<p>Salsa has a\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\">REST</a>-based\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface\">API</a> for authenticating and for creating and retrieving objects in the Salsa system.  For RePurpose, that meant creating and listing supporters (Salsa&#39;s name for a volunteer record), listing donation pages, listing donations, and listing completed actions like making a pledge or writing a letter to an editor.  In the context of RePurpose we were most interested in listing completed donations and completed actions so we could award the person who completed the task with their RePurpose points.  Since we could get all this information via the API, and since the API can list objects created since a certain timestamp, we set up a scheduled job to poll the API and ask for anything new that has come in since the last record we retrieved.  This job runs every 10 minutes and gets us pretty close to realtime - if you make a donation through one of the Salsa donation pages that&#39;s connected to a RePurpose task, your points will be credited to you within 5 minutes on average.</p>\n\n<h2>Amicus Exports</h2>\n\n<p>The Amicus API was still a work in progress during the RePurpose project, so we could not use it - but they did have an on-demand user export that could be programmatically triggered.  Since the user export contained all the information we needed about how many calls a user had attempted and how many friends they had invited on Facebook, this would get us where we needed to be.  We would import the Amicus users nightly on a schedule and load them into auxiliary tables in the RePurpose database, which were then used to award credit to the folks making calls and inviting friends.  Since we could trigger the export on demand, we also added a button to the RePurpose admin area to allow administrators to reload the Amicus data on demand and credit any new arrivals.</p>\n\n<h2>Matching</h2>\n\n<p>You&#39;ve heard how we get the data into the RePurpose system, but how do we match the volunteers from the various external systems up with the users in RePurpose?  </p>\n\n<p>There are all kinds of pitfalls in implementing person matching, like trying to match up on variations of a first name, or variations of a street address, or keeping track of previous known-good addresses.  Complexity can quickly spiral out of control for marginal benefit.  For this project we went with a simple assumption - all matching would occur via email address.  So if a user was doing things in the field, which gets recorded into VAN - they should use the same email address that they would use to create their RePurpose account.  Likewise for Salsa and Amicus.  Since each of these external systems stores an email address for the volunteer, with this simple assumption, the matching logic becomes simple - comparing lowercase versions of email addresses.</p>\n\n<h2>Awarding Credit</h2>\n\n<p>There were some wrinkles with awarding credit for tasks performed in external systems.  Since each task hinged on an external datapoint, it was critical to uniquely identify these datapoints.  For most tasks, the granularity of data allowed us to use the primary key of the foreign data source as the unique identifier.  In some cases the data would just be an aggregate count, like &quot;15 calls made&quot; - in which case we would generate our own idempotent IDs for those calls so as to award credit once and have a way to prevent awarding credit for the same call a second time.  In addition to keeping things crediting properly, this had the added benefit of allowing any RePurpose points in the system can be traced back to the explicit data point in the external system that was responsible for creating them.</p>\n\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n\n<p>Now that you&#39;ve seen how we took three different approaches to integrate\nwith three different systems, you&#39;re probably thinking that integration\ncan be tricky.  But if you&#39;re in a progressive organization that uses\nVAN, Salsa, or Amicus - remember that <a href=\"http://dockyard.com/contact\">here at DockYard we have the\nexpertise and experience to make it look\neasy</a>.</p>\n","summary":"A description of techniques used to integrate with various vendors on a recent DockYard project for the AFL-CIO's Super PAC Worker's Voice.","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["politics","postgresql"],"date":"2013-01-03T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"community/2012/10/26/openhack-boston","title":"OpenHack Boston 1.0","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p><img src=\"/images/openhack.png\" alt=\"OpenHack\">\nLast night we hosted Boston&#39;s first\n<a href=\"http://openhack.github.com/\">OpenHack</a>\nevent.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/qrush\">Nick Quaranto</a> started OpenHack at his <a href=\"http://coworkbuffalo.com/\">CoWorkBuffalo</a> office space,\nbased upon <a href=\"http://bostonrb.org\">BostonRB</a>&#39;s former (don&#39;t get me\nstarted) Hackfests.

For the time being, it is named <code>ArrayOverlap</code>\nand can be called from a <code>Arel::Attribute</code> as <code>#array_overlap</code>. It\nis likely that this will be renamed to <code>Overlap</code> and <code>#overlap</code>,\nrespectively, in the next release of postgres_ext.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>user_arel = <span class=\"constant\">User</span>.arel_table\n\n<span class=\"constant\">User</span>.where(user_arel[<span class=\"symbol\">:tags</span>].array_overlap([<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">one</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>,<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">two</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>])).to_sql\n<span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; SELECT \\&quot;users\\&quot;.* FROM \\&quot;users\\&quot; WHERE \\&quot;users\\&quot;.\\&quot;tags\\&quot; &amp;&amp; '{one,two}'</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>One case that we have used an array column in tandem with the overlap\noperator was adding tags to a user. We had three tags that could be\nplaced on a user, so we stored this data an array column. We then had a\nsearch form which had a multiselect field for that tags column. The\nmultiselect would give us an array of possible values that we wanted to\nfind records that had any of those selected values. So instead of\ncrafting a statement with multiple <code>ANY</code> queries <code>OR</code>ed together, we\nused overlap instead, resulting in only one predicate.</p>\n\n<h2>INET/CIDR subnet inclusion</h2>\n\n<p>In PostgreSQL, you can see if a particular INET address is contained in\na specific subnet with the contained within operator, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight sql \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>inet <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">192.168.1.6</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span> &lt;&lt; inet <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">10.0.0.0/24</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\n<span class=\"comment\">-- f</span>\n\ninet <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">192.168.1.6</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span> &lt;&lt; inet <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">192.168.1.0/24</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\n<span class=\"comment\">-- t</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>In postgres_ext, I added a new Arel predicate node for the \ncontained within operator.

He came\non board at a time when our company was not very stable but we needed to\ngrow to accomodate the larger contracts we wanted. I want to discuss the\nrisks and benefits on making the first hire.</p>\n\n<h2>You will lose money</h2>\n\n<p>One of the first things you learn about making your first full-time hire\nbeyond the founders is that you will most likely lose money. Which is\nkind of backwards because the entire point of hiring is so more money\ncan be made. Brian Kaney at <a href=\"http://vermonster.com\">Vermonster</a> told me this after we had already\nhired Dan. I was accustomed to balancing 3 people&#39;s salaries and now a\n4th was in play and we didn&#39;t have any extra money coming in. So we the\npartners had to take less money. After Brian told me that Vermonster had\nsimilar growing pains it made me feel better. I&#39;ve since spoken with\nothers that have said the same. I suspect this is partly due to my\ninexperience as a first time business owner, if I ever start another\ncompany I can plan better for this. It is also due simply to the fact\nthat we didn&#39;t have any extra work coming in and were now dividing the\nmoney 4 ways instead of 3. The employees have to be paid, the partners\ndon&#39;t. I took on the brunt of the risk and actually just started paying\nmyself for the first time in 2012 at the start of August. It was totally\nworth it.</p>\n\n<h2>Be picky who you hire</h2>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to say that Dan hired himself rather than we hired him. He was\nsomewhat new to the Boston Ruby community but was going out of his way\nto make himself known. He took the initiative to introduce himself to\nme and wanted to make contributions to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bostonrb/bostonrb\">BostonRB website</a>.\nHe developed a feature, made a pull request, and I gave him feedback.\nWhat impressed me was how quickly he adapted to the feedback I gave him.\nThis told me one thing: Dan was a very quick learner. Before DockYard\nwas even looking to hire Dan contacted me and expressed interest in\nbeing hired. When it came time for us to make a hire he was the first\nname that came to mind. I think the lesson to learn here is if you want\nto work somewhere, don&#39;t wait for them to hire for your talent. Contact\nthem, let them know you are interested even if they don&#39;t have anything\navailable. When the time comes they&#39;ll remember you.</p>\n\n<h2>Make full-time hires, don&#39;t contract to hire</h2>\n\n<p>We hired Dan on a contract-to-hire basis. The idea at the time was to\nhave Dan on a &quot;trial&quot; period, test him out, see how he fit. I didn&#39;t\nlike how this went and I don&#39;t think it was fair to Dan to hire this\nway. If you are hiring for a position, hire full-time. If things aren&#39;t\nworking out you are always within your rights to let the person go.\nWhenever you are hiring someone there is always the risk that it won&#39;t\nwork out.</p>\n\n<h2>Be mindful of taxes, benefits, salaries, etc...</h2>\n\n<p>Now that we had our first full-time on board we had to standardize\neverything. The best way to describe how I was handling all of this up\nuntil our first hire is &quot;half-assed&quot;. I was the only one living in\nMassachusetts where it was required to have health-care so I was using\nthe MA Health Connector (a terrible service), we were handling time-off\nas &quot;whenever you want&quot; which of course doesn&#39;t fly well as you scale,\nand taxes were a mystery to me. Let&#39;s break each one down to see what\nwe&#39;ve done:</p>\n\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n\n<p>I went for the best health-care I could find for employees. When it\ncomes down to it we&#39;re only talking about the difference of a few hundred\ndollars each month. If we go under because of this cost then I deserve\nto lose my company. If one of my employees cannot see the doctor they\nneed to because of sub-standard health coverage I run the risk that they\nwill not be back to work as quickly as they would otherwise. This risk\ncosts far more than the extra $$$ for the better plans.</p>\n\n<p>DockYard is currently covering 3/4 of the healthcare and I hope to bring\nthat up to 100% in 2013.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re doing 3 weeks of paid vacation per year. Employees can take off\ntwo weeks at a time. I am also experimenting with how to handle\novertime. Because we&#39;re doing client work and sometimes deadlines have\nto be met I&#39;ve told everyone that there will be a day when they get\nLumberged. I&#39;m going to be the guy that will have to ask people to work\nover a weekend, I don&#39;t like it and I would be pissed if I was on the\nreceiving end of that. So, to compensate we&#39;ll offer an added vacation\nday in exchange for each weekend day. Of course employees can say &quot;no&quot;\nto working on the weekend. I understand that there are sometimes plans\nthat are made well in advance.</p>\n\n<h3>Payroll</h3>\n\n<p>This is something we have struggled with. Everyone has always been paid\nbut sometimes it has been a day late because of mistakes on my part.\nOriginally I was cutting checks to everyone and mailing them myself. I\nwould manually enter the data into QuickBooks for our accountant. This\nsucks. I eventually got it down to where it would only take me 5 minutes\nto do but for a while it was pretty disruptive. We eventually moved over\nDirect Deposit through QuickBooks. This was much better, and quicker. If\nyou are not doing Direct Deposit you should highly consider it.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve recently moved from QuickBooks to Less Accounting and Sure\nPayroll. QuickBooks blows. We only used it because our accountant\nsuggested it. Here is some advice: don&#39;t let your accountant make\nsoftware decisions for you, especially if you are a software\nconsultancy. Our accountant is awesome, but QuickBooks is not. We lost\nan entire month of payroll, tax, and vendor payment data because a\nQuickBooks file corrupted. Never again.</p>\n\n<h3>Salaries, taxes</h3>\n\n<p>One <em>huge</em> mistake I made even before hiring Dan but continued into a\nmonth after he was hired was not withholding taxes from paychecks. We\nwere losing money after our first quarterly taxes were paid and I couldn&#39;t figure it out. In retrospect it is\npretty obvious what I should have been doing but keep in mind this was\nmy first company, I never had to deal with this before, and simply\nfucked up. Things turned around after I corrected this. I didn&#39;t ask for\nemployees to payback the money. I&#39;m not trying to push this idea that\nI&#39;m a &quot;good guy&quot; but this was my screw up and I took the hit.</p>\n\n<p>Also, pay people well. &quot;Industry average salary&quot; will earn you &quot;industry\naverage employees&quot;. If it is well known that you are paying high\nsalaries you will attract talented people. Talented people will more\nthan make up the difference.</p>\n\n<h2>Hiring ain&#39;t easy</h2>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve heard the term &quot;peak people&quot; thrown around a lot recently. It\nrefers to the huge talent shortage that the tech industry has. It&#39;s\ntrue, it exists. You know why? Because everybody wants to hire top\ntalent and nobody wants to train. I think it is pretty bullshit for\ncompanies to not train developers. Personally I would rather hire a\ndeveloper that requires training that is a quick learner than hire a\nmid-level dev that is set in his/her ways. We got lucky with Dan, he\nrequired very little ramping up. Mostly just a push here and a push\nthere. We&#39;ve recently hired Doug Yun as a trainee. I told Doug that we\nare experimenting with him, I want to establish a training program at\nDockYard. So there will be ups and downs to it as we establish a\nplaybook. I realize we run the risk of devs training up, then bouncing\nout. There are ways to address this. We can offer employment term\nbenefits. If you are at DockYard for a year your salary will increase by\nX% every year. Let them know what the path for advancement is. We need\nto get better at this and it is something I want to focus on over the next\nfew months. I would love to hear feedback and how others are\napproaching this.</p>\n\n<h2>It pushes you to make things happen</h2>\n\n<p>The best benefit of hiring is that it personally motivates me to grow\nthe company. When it was just the co-founders we always had the fallback \nthat a payroll period could be skipped. As I mentioned earlier that is\nnot a choice when you have employees. Money must come in, people must\nget paid. Personally I have found this to be a good motivator for\ngrowing DockYard.</p>\n\n<h2>Share your experiences!</h2>\n\n<p>If you agree/disagree with anything I said, have a different\nperspective, or any general advice I&#39;d love to hear it.</p>\n","summary":"What to expect when you start hiring","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["opinion","business"],"date":"2012-08-30T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"ruby/2012/06/26/rails-4-sneak-peek-async-actionmailer","title":"Rails 4.0 Sneak Peek: Asynchronous ActionMailer","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>My previous <a href=\"http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/ruby/2012/06/25/rails-4-sneak-peek-queueing.html\">deep dive into the Rails 4.0 Queueing system</a>\n was motivated by a patch to Rails I was working on while at <a href=\"http:/railscamps.org\">RailsCamp New England</a> this past weekend.

You push an object on to the queue and\nthat object is expected to respond to a <code>run</code> method. Let&#39;s take a look:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"class\">TestJob</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">run</span>\n    puts <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">I am running!</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n\n<span class=\"constant\">Rails</span>.queue.push(<span class=\"constant\">TestJob</span>.new)\n=&gt; <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">I am running!</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>For most people, that is pretty much it. The queue is running in a\nseparate thread from the app thread, so your app shouldn&#39;t notice any\nresponse impact from an expensive job.</p>\n\n<p>The basic queue that comes with Rails is not a long-term solution. The\ngoal here is to establish a common API that more robust queueing systems\ncan plug themselves into. In most cases you shouldn&#39;t need to change any\nof your app code if you want to switch from\n<a href=\"https://github.com/defunkt/resque\">Resque</a> to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq\">Sidekiq</a>. You should take care that\nthe objects you are enqueing can be properly marshalled.</p>\n\n<p>You can even write your own queue, let&#39;s take a look at the API of a\ncustom queue</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"class\">MyQueue</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">push</span>(job)\n    job.run\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Then in your <code>application.rb</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>config.queue = <span class=\"constant\">MyQueue</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>This example is straight from the Rails test suite. This will define a\nqueue that does not run jobs asynchronously. As soon as the job is\npushed onto the queue it is run. Let&#39;s make an actual queue (without relying on\nthe Queue class)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"class\">MyQueue</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">initialize</span>\n    <span class=\"instance-variable\">@queue</span> = []\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">push</span>(job)\n    <span class=\"instance-variable\">@queue</span>.push(job)\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n\n  <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">pop</span>\n    <span class=\"instance-variable\">@queue</span>.pop\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>In this example we have implemented a simple queue. You will next need\nto tell Rails&#39;s QueueConsumer to use this queue. You can do this in\n<code>application.rb</code> with an initializer block:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>intializer <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">start queue consumer</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span> <span class=\"keyword\">do</span> |app|\n  app.queue_consumer = config.queue_consumer.start(app.queue)\n  at_exit { app.queue.consumer.shutdown }\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>and if we now push to our new queue:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"constant\">Rails</span>.queue.push(<span class=\"constant\">TestJob</span>.new)\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>...we get nothing. Why? Inspect the QueueConsumer:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"constant\">Rails</span>.application.queue_consumer\n=&gt; <span class=\"comment\">#&lt;Rails::Queueing::ThreadedConsumer @queue=#&lt;MyQueue @queue=[]&gt;, @thread=#&lt;Thread dead&gt;&gt;</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>So you&#39;ll notice that the thread is <code>dead</code>. We can force the queue to\nprocess by doing:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"constant\">Rails</span>.application.queue_consumer.start\n=&gt; <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">I am running!</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Let&#39;s back up to understand what is going on here. First we&#39;ll start by looking at <code>ThreadedConsumer#start</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">start</span>\n  <span class=\"instance-variable\">@thread</span> = <span class=\"constant\">Thread</span>.new <span class=\"keyword\">do</span>\n    <span class=\"keyword\">while</span> job = <span class=\"instance-variable\">@queue</span>.pop\n      <span class=\"keyword\">begin</span>\n        job.run\n      <span class=\"keyword\">rescue</span> <span class=\"constant\">Exception</span> =&gt; e\n        handle_exception e\n      <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n    <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n  <span class=\"predefined-constant\">self</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>So this thread is only staying alive as long as the <code>@queue.pop</code> returns a truthy value.\nIt&#39;s not reasonable or us to keep shoving something into the queue, so let&#39;s see what is happening \nin <code>Queue#pop</code>. For this we&#39;ll look at Rubinius&#39; implementation</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n<strong>20</strong>\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"comment\"># Retrieves data from the queue.

Our simple <code>MyQueue</code> class would return <code>nil</code> when <code>ThreadConsumer#start</code>\nis called because there is nothing in the queue and the thread would die. Even if we put something in\nqueue it would pop once, run the job, try to pop againg, then die.</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of simplicity let&#39;s just have <code>MyQueue</code> inherit from\n<code>Queue</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"class\">MyQueue</span> &lt; <span class=\"constant\">Queue</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now we can run</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"constant\">Rails</span>.queue.push(<span class=\"constant\">TestJob</span>.new)\n=&gt; <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">I am running!</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>The queue system in Rails 4.0 is a very simple solution, I&#39;m looking\nforward to the release and the support for it to be added to many of the\nleading background job processing libraries.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that as of this writing the master branch is still\nversioned as &#39;beta&#39;.

But since stressing out is not for me, I said to myself, &quot;Everyone was a beginner at one point,&quot; and chugged along.

It seems that most\nagencies are hush-hush on how they work internally. Or I just suck at\nthe Googles. In any event, I wanted to share our experience in the hope\nthat others can learn and give feedback.</p>\n\n<h2>Clients</h2>\n\n<p>Be selective! If your gut tells you something is wrong listen to it. I\nmade a huge mistake with taking our very first client and an even bigger\nmistake about re-signing with said client. It ended ugly, I always felt\nit might. The client was bad (no I won&#39;t say who it was) and it really\nput us in a very difficult position when we were getting started. I went\nback to re-sign because the first contract ended in December. It turns\nout December is a <em>terrible</em> month for finding new work. I panicked,\nrookie move. Thankfully we have had great clients since. That&#39;s not to\nsay we haven&#39;t had to dodge potentially bad clients from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>Some clients are just bad, but many are just &quot;bad for us&quot;. Those two\nstatements are very different and recognizing the difference is\nimportant. &quot;Bad for us&quot; clients might be fantasic people but the\nprojects aren&#39;t in our wheel house, in those cases I try my best to help\nthose people find other consultancies/freelancers.</p>\n\n<h2>Employees</h2>\n\n<h3>Salary</h3>\n\n<p>DockYard started as bringing together three freelance developers. The\nfirst mistake I made was not insisting that everyone start on fulltime\nsalary. We were still paying out the full hourly rates then paying taxes\non top of that. Needless to say, accounting is not my strong point. It\ntook 2 months before I figured out why we weren&#39;t making any money.\nWhoops.</p>\n\n<h3>Process</h3>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve changed from the &quot;anything goes&quot; type boss to the &quot;I&#39;m going to be\nthe hard-ass&quot; over the past six months. Here is why: we want to balance\nmultiple projects. Finding a client that has enough of a budget for a 6\nperson team is great but not very likely if we stick with startups. So\nour team sizes are small, but we need to be redundant. I tell everyone\non my team that they &quot;need to be replacable&quot;. Don&#39;t take this statement\nthe wrong way, I&#39;m clear that this doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re getting canned\nat the drop of a hat. It means that I don&#39;t want to be in a position\nwhere someone gets sick, goes on vacation, or leaves for another\nopportunity and we plug someone else into that project and it takes that\nperson a week to ramp up because we need to figure out what the last\nperson was doing. <em>Process is very important</em>, I would rather have good\ndevelopers that buy into our process than have awesome developers that\ndon&#39;t. We function best as a team. So when someone isn&#39;t buying into the\nprocess we&#39;ve been outlining I need to be the guy that says &quot;no&quot;. A few times this\nhas turned into debates, sometimes into arguments. I&#39;m willing to modify\nour process if something better is proposed but I&#39;m not willing to\nswitch into the &quot;just get it done&quot;. At the start I avoided uncomfortable conversations, \nif something was happening that I didn&#39;t think was right for DockYard I would wait it out.\nThis was a bad idea, the best time to correct something is now. Today I \nam jumping on these things immediately. I would rather have an airing of grievances \nwhen the issue is small rather than let it blow up.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some things that, arguably, are\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson&#x27;s_Law_of_Triviality\">bikeshedding</a>\nbut I have been insisting on:</p>\n\n<h3>The trivial</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Whitespace</li>\n<li>Single quotes instead of double quotes</li>\n<li>Verbose variable names</li>\n<li>Consistency between backend model names and HTML markup class names</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The important</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Testing</li>\n<li>Code quality</li>\n<li>CoffeeScript</li>\n<li>File/class naming conventions and organization</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Remotes</h3>\n\n<p>We started as entirely remote team. Angelo in Rhode Island, Russ in\nMaine, and myself in Boston. This is OK but I must admit I&#39;m not a big\nfan of this. We have been hiring in Boston and will continue to grow a\nteam here.</p>\n\n<h2>Rates</h2>\n\n<p>We originally started at $120/hour. We have since moved to a flat\n$4,000/week per developer. This buys the client about 32 hours of our\ntime.\nThis has been the single best change we&#39;ve made. Keeping track of every\nhours sucks, and I had to be on everyone&#39;s ass making sure they got\ntheir hours in. Now it is pretty simple. The clients also prefer this\nsystem of invoicing, especially many of the large enterprise type\nclients we are looking to go after.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, I think our rate is below our market value. I&#39;ve spoken\nwith many other consultancies and the average seems to be $6k - 7k per\nweek for full stack (which we are). We are planning on raising our rates\nto $5k in September then hopefully up to $6k by next year. It&#39;s not that\nI don&#39;t think we are technically qualified to justify those rates yet,\nits that I want to build out our portfolio first.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve noticed that many people don&#39;t want to talk about money. I actually\ndon&#39;t mind it, to the point that some people might find it annoying. In\norder for the market to adjust properly I think an open discussion on\nrates is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>I have also started telling potential clients our minimum project budget\n($30k) before we get into any details of the engagement. Some might find\nthis off-putting. Here is my perspective: the client&#39;s time is valuable\nand I don&#39;t want to waste their time. In most cases budget is a deciding\nfactor, let&#39;s get that out into the open immediately rather than dealing\nwith surprises a month from now.</p>\n\n<p>We have reduced our rates to work on interesting projects. We&#39;re nearly\ndone with a real-time chat app using an EventMachine backend with a\nwebsocket front end. That was a fun one to build, we reduced our rate by\n17% because of the client&#39;s limited budget.</p>\n\n<h2>Business Development</h2>\n\n<p>This is something I have learned as I go. Not to toot my own horn but I\nbelieve one of my strengths is selling DockYard as a business to\npotential clients. Finding new clients has not been easy. Here are some\nthings that led directly to client contact (sorted by most effective):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Writing blog posts</li>\n<li>Giving presentations to general tech audiences (more beginners than\nexperts)</li>\n<li>LinkedIn</li>\n<li>Referrals</li>\n<li>Being found on Google</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>LinkedIn?? Yeah, it actually worked. But I did something incredibly\ndouchey. I modified my LinkedIn profile to basically be an ad for\nDockYard then I went to LinkedIn&#39;s &quot;People you may know&quot; page and\nclicked on over a thousand people. I got flagged for spamming but it\nworked. Yes, I know it was a huge douchebag move. However, I suspected\nthat people would look at my profile to see if they knew me, or wanted\nto be connected. If they happened to have a development need they would\ncontact me, if they didn&#39;t they wouldn&#39;t. At the very least I was\nexposing DockYard to many people. I went from less than 100 LinkedIn\nconnections to close to 1000 in a week. We got two contracts from doing\nthis, it was worth it.</p>\n\n<p>Here are things that have not worked for us (yet)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Running Community Events</li>\n<li>Sponsoring</li>\n<li>Open Source Development (see the comments for some interesting debate on this topic)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I organize <a href=\"http://bostonrb.org\">BostonRB</a>, it is one of the largest\nRuby user groups in the world. We have awesome speakers every month.\nEvery now and then when I talk shop with someone about work I get the\n&quot;I&#39;m sure running BostonRB doesn&#39;t hurt&quot; with a wink. I find this\nannoying. I&#39;ve gone out of my way to make sure BostonRB doesn&#39;t get\nco-opted by any one company for promotional purposes. There is another\n&quot;Boston Rails Meetup&quot; in Newton, MA that is essentially used to boost\nSEO for another consultancy. I think this is bullshit. I&#39;ll say it right\nnow: We have never been contacted by a client because of running\nBostonRB. I&#39;m not saying I would turn any down, but in my experience\nrunning a user group is not driving clients to us.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I&#39;m getting off my soapbox in the upcoming months DockYard will\nbe listed as a Sponsor for BostonRB, along with every other company that\nis donating time, pizza, meeting space, etc...</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a huge advocate for Open Source Development, but it also has very\npoor ROI if your goal is to get clients. I believe there is a threshold\nfor this, if you&#39;re on a certain tier (i.e. core committer to a popular\nframework) it might be different.</p>\n\n<h2>Targeting Startups</h2>\n\n<p>On any given day people will hear me complain about startups. By their\nvery definition startups don&#39;t have money. As a consultancy we are\nlooking to make money by engaging clients. If anybody tells you they&#39;re\nconsulting because it is their passion or work with startups, they are\nfull of shit. This is a cash game. Demand is at an all time high, there\nis a lot of opportunity to do well and work for yourself. While some of\nthe technology challenges startups present are very interesting I am\nalso running a business. This is why we have begun to favor enterprise.\nWe can get longer term contracts and these companies pay on time. The\ndownside is the technology is not terribly interesting.</p>\n\n<p>We are striving to find a balance here. I would be interested in hearing\nothers experience.</p>\n\n<h2>Doing Too Much</h2>\n\n<p>Right now I&#39;m the guy wearing all of the hats. On any given day I&#39;m\ndoign the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Biz development</li>\n<li>Marketing</li>\n<li>Lead Development</li>\n<li>Project Management</li>\n<li>Paying bills</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thankfully I haven&#39;t burnt out yet but this cannot continue much longer.\nThe biggest mistake I have made over the first six months was not making\nan early hire to take some of this load off. I must admit, this one\nstumps me. I know how to hire a good developer, I know how to hire a\ngood designer. I have no idea how to hire for non-tech positions. We\nhave already hired a accountant to handle some of the larger items but\nI&#39;m still responsible for every day invoicing and book keeping. In my\nmind, here are the priority hires:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Business developer. I have had light feelers out for this position\nover the past few months. We really need someone focused on this\nfulltime. Ideally someone that wants to hook into the startup community\nin Boston or has existing sales relationships in the enterprise world.\nOr if you happen to be in DC and have existing connection in the\npolitical world we&#39;d love to talk. <a href=\"mailto:contact@dockyard.com\">Contact\nus</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Office manager. We will be moving into our own space in the Fall. At\nthat time we will be looking to fill this position.</p></li>\n<li><p>More developers and designers.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Our Process</h2>\n\n<p>We have modified how to engage clients. This is what we are currently\ndoing</p>\n\n<h3>Initial Engagement</h3>\n\n<p>Phone call, get to know the client. Determine if we are a good fit. If\nso and the client is happy with references, rate, etc... we move\nforward.</p>\n\n<h3>Kick off</h3>\n\n<p>We charge for this. Currently it is $1000. We will sit down the client and\nwill run through what they want soup to nuts. We&#39;ll have development and\ndesign on hand for this meeting.</p>\n\n<h3>Design Phase</h3>\n\n<p>We originally combined development and design after the kickoff. This\nwas a mistake. There is a lot to be learned by doing an upfront design\nphase. It helps us make informed estimations. The clients are happier\nwhen we can deliver what we estimate. This phase we generally go for\nwireframes and workflow. Nothing polished. We like to wireframe in\nHTML/CSS.</p>\n\n<h3>Development Phase</h3>\n\n<p>Now that we have the general design worked out we begin development.\nThere will also be design done during this phase as well.</p>\n\n<p>I would love to hear about other processes. What works, what doesn&#39;t\nwork.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>I hope some peope find this information useful. Please feel free to ask\nany questions or if you need me to elaborate on anything. If you feel\nI&#39;m off the mark or have suggestions feel free to comment as well. We&#39;re\nalways looking to improve.</p>\n","summary":"Brian talks about what has worked, what has not worked, and the changes that have been made at DockYard during its first six month","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["opinion","business","consulting"],"date":"2012-06-21T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"ruby/2012/06/18/postgres_ext-adding-postgres-data-types-to-active-record","title":"postgres_ext: Adding Postgres data types to Rails","dockyarder":"dan-mcclain","body":"<p>Over the past few weeks, I have been working on a new gem which adds\nsupport to Rail&#39;s ActiveRecord for PostgreSQL&#39;s native data types.

I would have a tab for\n<a href=\"http://git-scm.org\">git</a> (was using <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/macvim/\">MacVim</a>), on for <code>rails s</code> or <code>tail\nlog/development.log</code>, one for running tests (now using <code>guard</code> or\n<code>autotest</code>), one for <code>rails c</code> and lastly one for <code>rails db</code>. Detaching\nfrom a screen session allowed me to have a full environment running\nuntil my next reboot, I could switch back into the project quickly, and\nI had configured my <code>.screenrc</code> to open these tabs everytime I started\nscreen.</p>\n\n<p>I also utilized screen to keep sessions open on a remote server between\nSSH connects. Instantiating a screen session on the remote server\nwould keep processes running even when my SSH connection would get\nkilled. This would prevent an <code>apt-get upgrade</code> from fragging the system\nincase I disconnected, or allow me to drop the connection during a long\nrunning process.</p>\n\n<p>As much as I used it, I was still a screen newb, as my <code>.screenrc</code> was\npretty vanilla. I hadn&#39;t taken the time to read the man\npages/tutorials out there to understand some of the more subtle\nfeatures.</p>\n\n<h2>Tmux and Brian P. Hogan&#39;s &#39;tmux&#39; book</h2>\n\n<p>I had noticed that <a href=\"http://tmux.sourceforge.net\">tmux</a> was getting a decent amount of attention, so\nwhen I started at DockYard, I told myself I would only use tmux.  I also\nswitched from MacVim to terminal vim, which works better when pair\nprogramming.  <a href=\"http://www.bphogan.com\">Brian P. Hogan</a> recently wrote\n<a href=\"http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux\">tmux: Productive Mouse-Free Development</a> for Pragmatic Programmers.  After reading his book, I have a solid <code>.tmux.conf</code> and a great understanding of tmux.</p>\n\n<h2>Tmux and Pair Programming</h2>\n\n<p>The one disadvantage of everyone at DockYard working remotely is that you can&#39;t\njust turn around and ask someone to come to your desk to pair up. Tmux\nallows multiple users to connect to a specific session.  With a bit of\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS\">dynamic DNS</a> magic, port forwarding, and ssh tunneling, multiple people\ncan connect to the same tmux session, work in the same vim window, and\nsee the same development server.</p>\n\n<p>The first step is dynamic DNS and port forwarding, which I won&#39;t cover\nhere, since everyone has different modems and routers. You want to\nforward port 22 through your router/firewall to your development\nmachine. Using dynamic DNS, you can connect to your coworkers via a\ndomain like <code>dan.example.com</code> instead of figuring out your IP and\nsending that to your partner.</p>\n\n<p>We use the following ssh command to forward connection on our local\nmachine to the other person&#39;s</p>\n<div class=\"highlight  \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>ssh dan.example.com -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>The above command forwards any request on port 3000 on my machine the\none to which I am connected. That way, I can see what my partner sees\nwhen we edit files on his machine.  Once connected, I just attach to my\npartner&#39;s tmux session.  At this point, we are programming in the same\nterminal session, and we can both see the edits as we make them.  We use\na Google+ Hangout to communicate while we pair program.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>With a tmux, ssh port forwarding, and Google+ Hangout, you can create a\nuseful pair programming environment with your remote coworkers.  We find\nthis setup very effective and use it often to work together and tackle\nan issue.</p>\n","summary":"Pair programming at distance","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ruby","workflow"],"date":"2012-04-10T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"ruby/2012/04/03/use-association-extensions-to-build-join-attributes-on-a-hmt","title":"Use Association Extensions to Build Join Attributes on a HMT","dockyarder":"russ-jones","body":"<p>It&#39;s common in Rails to use a <code>has_many :through</code> relationship to model User/Group Memberships. \nSometimes we have extra data in the join that we would like to make use of, but getting that \ndata in there can be combersome depending on our approach.

We went with Jenkins since we are writing client code, so\n<a href=\"http://travis-ci.org\">travis-ci.org</a> is out of the question (for now).</p>\n\n<p>Our CI server is running on Ubuntu 10.04. We are using nginx as a\nreverse proxy infront of our Jenkins server. Our basic setup is the same\nas <a href=\"http://bostonrb.org/presentations/jenkins-rails\">the presentation I gave at Boston RB in January</a>.\nThere are a few upgrades I have made since then.  First, I set up the\nGitHub authentication plugin. The other plugin I installed was the\nCampfire notification plugin. Since we are all remote, we use Campfire\nas our main line of communication. Having Jenkins notify us in Campfire\nallows us to see when new code is pushed to master, and when someone\nbreaks the build.</p>\n\n<h2>RSpec HTML formatter + Jenkins = Every Build is successful (even when it isn&#39;t)</h2>\n\n<p>As we found out the hard way, using the RSpec HTML formatter from within\njenkins is not the best idea.  The problem is the HTML formatter returns\nthe same exit code regardless of whether or not the suite passes. This\nis a huge problem, as you end up with false positives.</p>\n\n<h2>Enter ci_reporter</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/nicksieger/ci_reporter\">ci_reporter</a> gem provides a rake\ntask that generates a set of xml reports that Jenkins can interpret and\ngive us a more complete picture of our test suite. Jenkins will plot the\nnumber of failure over time, display test duration, and provide a number \nof other stats you can utilize. </p>\n\n<h2>Capybara-webkit + Xvfb + headless = Javascript without opening a browser</h2>\n\n<p>We are using capybara to run our <a href=\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/257-request-specs-and-capybara\">request\nspecs</a>.\nWhen our request spec needs javascript, we use \n<a href=\"https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit\">Capybara-webkit</a> as our\njavascript driver. Capybara-webkit is a\nwebkit capybara driver, allowing you to run javascript in a headless\nwebkit instance.  It accomplishes this by using QtWebKit. On Ubuntu, to\nutilize capybara-webkit, you need an X Server running when you run your\ntest.  To accomplish this, I installed Xvfb, which will create a\nvirtual framebuffer.  To instantiate xvfb, I used the headless\ngem, which is a ruby wrapper for xvfb.  With headless, I don&#39;t have to\ndo any bash scripting to get a framebuffer ready before we run our\ntests. </p>\n\n<p>I added the following code to our <code>spec_helper.rb</code> file</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>config.before(<span class=\"symbol\">:suite</span>) <span class=\"keyword\">do</span>\n  <span class=\"instance-variable\">@headless</span> = <span class=\"constant\">Headless</span>.new\n  <span class=\"instance-variable\">@headless</span>.start\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n\nconfig.after(<span class=\"symbol\">:suite</span>) <span class=\"keyword\">do</span>\n  <span class=\"instance-variable\">@headless</span>.destroy\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>The above spippet creates the headless instance and creates the\nframebuffer at the beginning of the test suite, and destorys it\nafterwards.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Overall, I&#39;m pretty happy with our set up as it is. The one issue I have\nwith it is the way ci_reporter and jenkins interact. Since Jenkins was\norigianlly built for Java, builds are BROKEN when they don&#39;t build, but\nUNSTABLE when their tests fail.  UNSTABLE builds are seen as successful.\nI would rather an UNSTABLE build be seen as a failure, since the\ncampfire notification plugin plays the same sound for successful and\nunstable builds.  I may poke around with the plugin or ci_reporter to\nhave jenkins notify us of builds in a way that makes more sense.</p>\n","summary":"What we are doing to keep our developers honest with their tests","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ruby","testing","linux"],"date":"2012-03-05T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"announcement/2012/02/27/dan-mcclain-is-a-dockyarder","title":"Dan McClain is a DockYarder","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p><img src=\"/images/dan-mcclain.png\" alt=\"Dan McClain\"></p>\n\n<p>Today I&#39;m happy to announce that Dan McClain is joining our team!

An\nexample of this is our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/invitable\">Invitable</a> engine. As you may\nhave guessed, it adds invitation request support to an existing app.\nIt&#39;s about 50% complete right now but for the purposes of this post it\nwill act as the example.</p>\n\n<p>As an engine it has a very slim <code>Invitation</code> model that only\nexpects an <code>email</code> attribute. A client app we&#39;re currently\nbuilding requires two additional attributes to be gathered: <code>name</code> and <code>zipcode</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There is no need to overwrite the model, I just want to extend it. The cleanest \nthing to do is just monkey patch it.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start with writing the spec of where I want the model to be (I am\nusing <a href=\"https://github.com/bcardarella/valid_attribute\">ValidAttribute</a> if\nthe specs don&#39;t look familiar, I suggest you try it test spec your\nvalidations)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>require <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">spec_helper</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\n\ndescribe <span class=\"constant\">Invitable</span>::<span class=\"constant\">Invitation</span> <span class=\"keyword\">do</span>\n  it { should     have_valid(<span class=\"symbol\">:name</span>).when(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">Henry Ford</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>) }\n  it { should_not have_valid(<span class=\"symbol\">:name</span>).when(<span class=\"predefined-constant\">nil</span>, <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>) }\n  it { should     have_valid(<span class=\"symbol\">:zipcode</span>).when(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">02115</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>) }\n  it { should_not have_valid(<span class=\"symbol\">:zipcode</span>).when(<span class=\"predefined-constant\">nil</span>, <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">hello</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">0211</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">021156</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>) }\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>To make this spec green there are two things that I have to do</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Add the <code>name</code> and <code>zipcode</code> columsn to the correct table</li>\n<li>Open up the class and add the proper validations on those attributes</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The first is simple. I just create a new migration and add the columns\nto <code>invitable_invitations</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The second is not so straight forward. If I open up the class in the client app and\nattempt to add the validations like so:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"keyword\">module</span> <span class=\"class\">Invitable</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"class\">Invitation</span>\n    validates <span class=\"symbol\">:name</span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:zipcode</span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:presence</span> =&gt; <span class=\"predefined-constant\">true</span>\n    validates <span class=\"symbol\">:zipcode</span>, <span class=\"symbol\">:format</span> =&gt; <span class=\"regexp\"><span class=\"delimiter\">/</span><span class=\"content\">^</span><span class=\"char\">\\d</span><span class=\"content\">{5}$|^</span><span class=\"char\">\\d</span><span class=\"content\">{5}-</span><span class=\"char\">\\d</span><span class=\"content\">{4}$</span><span class=\"delimiter\">/</span></span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>The app will raise a <code>NoMethodError</code> exception complaining that\n<code>validates</code> is undefined. In the load path there are two\n<code>app/models/invitable/invitation.rb</code> files and the one in the app takes precendence\nover the one in the engine. This is fine because you might want to\noverwrite the model entirely, but in this case I want to extend it. So\nyou must explicitly require the engine&#39;s model at the top of the app&#39;s model.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully the engine itself has a nice helper <code>called_from</code> that tracks its full path\non the file system. In this example we access it with\n<code>Invitable::Engine.called_from</code>. This will point to the <code>lib/invitable</code> directory\nin the gem itself. Here is what I ended up with in the model:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td

Let&#39;s discuss some conventions for keeping it clean and\nwhat should and shouldn&#39;t go in there.</p>\n\n<h2>It&#39;s not a dump</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/dump.jpg\" alt=\"Dump\"></p>\n\n<p>Does this look familiar? It does to me. This is what my <code>lib/</code> directory\nlooked like before I got fed up with it. That truck, that was me dumping more\ncode into <code>lib/</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience there is one outstanding reason why code ends up\ngetting dumped into the lib/ directory: A poor understanding of what a\nmodel is. Rails has this way of reinforcing bad habits. Perhaps because\nit is so easy to get going some developers never bother to learn that a\nmodel does not in any way need to be attached to a persitence layer.\n(i.e. ActiveRecord)</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s all agree to the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>All Business Logic Goes Into A Model</li>\n<li>All Models Go Into <code>app/models</code></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When we say &quot;Business Logic&quot; we are of course talking about &quot;Application\nSpecific Business Logic&quot;. There is always the case of something you&#39;re\nworking on that is so generic it can be shared with other applications\nyou are (or will be) working on. Or, even better, with the community in\ngeneral as Open Source. That brings me to the next point.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding the load path</h2>\n\n<p>If you have written a Rubygem, or at the very least, looked through one,\nyou know that the <code>lib/</code> directory is special. The short version of the\nstory is that Rubygems iterates over all of the libraries you have\ninstalled as a gem, and appends any <code>lib/</code> directories onto Ruby&#39;s Load\nPath. This is basically how Ruby gem files are exposed, so when you as\ndo a gem require it will iterate through every path in the load path and\ngive you the first match.</p>\n\n<p>This is also true with Rails. After all of your gems are loaded and your\napplication is up Rails will append <code>./lib/</code> to your load path. Any\nfiles you put in there can now be required the exact same way gems are.\nThis gives us an excellent path to extracting general functionality out\ninto. You can even play tricks with this, in your <code>application.rb</code> file\nput the following at the top:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"global-variable\">$:</span>.unshift(<span class=\"constant\">File</span>.expand_path(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">../../lib</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>, <span class=\"predefined-constant\">__FILE__</span>))\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now in your lib directory create an &#39;active_record&#39; directory and add a\nfile called &#39;base.rb&#39;. Inside that file add the following:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>raise <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\">ZOMG I BROKE RAILS!</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Load up your Rails app and watch it throw an exception. Why? Because\nyour app&#39;s <code>lib/</code> directory was prepended to the load paths and when the\nlookup for <code>active_record/base</code> happened the first match was in your\napp&#39;s <code>lib/</code> instead of in the proper gem. This of course is more of an interesting hack than anything really\nuseful. But it does do a good job of demonstrating how Rubygems&#39; lookup\nhappens.</p>\n\n<h2>Use initializers for initializing, that is all</h2>\n\n<p>I have seen developers dump code into initializers that has no business\nbeing there. Yes, it loads and it works. That is not the point. We have\nconventions for a reason. Any code that you feel needs to go into an\ninitializer and has nothing to do with actually setting preferences or\nsomething of that manner almost always should go into the <code>lib/</code>\ndirectory. If you <strong>must</strong> monkey patch. Put it into the <code>lib/</code>\ndirectory. If you are creating a new class or module that has no\nbusiness being in <code>app/models</code> put it in to the <code>lib/</code> directory.</p>\n\n<h2>Using lib/ to extend core, stlib, or a gem</h2>\n\n<p>Far too often I&#39;ve needed to extend a class that is being defined\noutside of my project. There are a few ways to deal with this. You can\nuse a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern\">Composite</a> to\ndefine a new class that you can then play around with. The downside to\nthis is that I sometimes want to modify a class that is being inherited\nby other classes. This is when I think it is appropriate to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch\">Monkey\nPatch</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern I have fallen upon is to define a <code>gem_ext/</code> directory and a\n<code>gem_ext.rb</code> file in lib. I then make sure the extensions are loaded up\nusing an initializer. For lack of a better term I call this\n<code>lib_loader.rb</code>. Lets start with the loader.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"comment\"># config/initializers/lib_loader.rb</span>\n\nrequire <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">gem_ext</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Simple enough. Now for this example I&#39;ll use a <a href=\"http://haml-lang.com/\">Haml</a> custom filter I wrote.\nThis filter allows me to write <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com\">Handlebars</a>\ntemplates in my views like so:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight haml \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>-<span class=\"comment\"># app/views/home/show.html.haml</span>\n\n<span class=\"comment\">:handlebars</span><span class=\"comment\">\n  // handlebars code goes here</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now I can easily add handlebar templates to any haml file. This is how I\ndid it.</p>\n\n<p>Under <code>lib/gem_ext</code> I defined a <code>haml/</code> directory and a <code>haml.rb</code> file. Then I defined <code>haml/custom_filters.rb</code> and inside that file\nI added</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n<strong>10</strong>\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"comment\"># lib/gem_ext/haml/custom_filters.rb</span>\n\n<span class=\"keyword\">module</span> <span class=\"class\">Haml::Filters</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">module</span> <span class=\"class\">Handlebars</span>\n    include <span class=\"constant\">Base</span>\n\n    <span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"function\">render_with_options</span>(text, options)\n      type = <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"content\"> type=</span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">#{</span>options[<span class=\"symbol\">:attr_wrapper</span>]<span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}</span></span><span class=\"content\">text/x-handlebars</span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">#{</span>options[<span class=\"symbol\">:attr_wrapper</span>]<span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}</span></span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>\n      <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&lt;&lt;-END</span></span><span class=\"string\"><span class=\"content\">\n&lt;script</span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">#{</span>type<span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}</span></span><span class=\"content\">&gt;\n//&lt;![CDATA[\n  </span><span class=\"inline\"><span class=\"inline-delimiter\">#{</span>text.rstrip.gsub(<span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"char\">\\n</span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>, <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span><span class=\"char\">\\n</span><span class=\"content\">    </span><span class=\"delimiter\">&quot;</span></span>)<span class=\"inline-delimiter\">}</span></span><span class=\"content\">\n//]]&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;</span><span class=\"delimiter\">\n      END</span></span>\n    <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">end</span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now in <code>haml.rb</code> I added</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"comment\"># lib/gem_ext/haml.rb</span>\n\nrequire <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">gem_ext/haml/custom_filters</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>And finally in <code>gem_ext.rb</code> I added</p>\n<div class=\"highlight ruby \"><div class=\"ribbon\"></div><div class=\"scroller\"><table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td class=\"line-numbers\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"comment\"># lib/gem_ext.rb</span>\n\nrequire <span class=\"string\"><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span><span class=\"content\">gem_ext/haml</span><span class=\"delimiter\">'</span></span>\n</pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n</div></div>\n<p>This gives me a very clean approach to extending classes without\nworrying about muddying up the load path with name collisions or other\nsurprises. In addition this pattern can\nbe repeated for <code>Core</code> and <code>Stdlib</code> classes in <code>core_ext</code> and <code>stdlib_ext</code>\nrespectively.</p>\n\n<h2>Using lib/ as a pattern to extracting Rubygems</h2>\n\n<p>A pattern I have fallen upon when wanting to extract functionality out\nof an app into a Rubygem has been to first extract that code into the\n<code>lib/</code> directoy. From there I have a nice way to test the code in\nisolation. I am also forced to write the code as a class independent\nfrom my app. After I am satisfied with what I have I can think about\nextracting that into an external gem.</p>\n\n<p>A great example of this is something that <a href=\"http://p-rob.me\">Patrick Robertson</a> wrote for\n<a href=\"http://bostonrb.org\">BostonRB</a></p>\n\n<p>We wanted to show the next upcoming event at the top of the website. All\nof our events are stored in a Google Calendar. Unfortunately most of the\nGoogle Calendar gems out there are crap. Patrick decided to roll his\nown.</p>\n\n<p>You can see that the <a href=\"https://github.com/bostonrb/bostonrb/blob/master/lib/boston_rb_calendar.rb\">boston<em>rb</em>calendar.rb</a>\nis requiring several files just like any Gem would. Because of the\nisolation <a href=\"https://github.com/bostonrb/bostonrb/blob/master/spec/lib/boston_rb_calendar_spec.rb\">he was able to test the class very easily</a>.</p>\n\n<p>From here, if Patrick wanted to release this as a gem it wouldn&#39;t take\ntoo much effort. Some renaming of classes would be required but he has\nall of the major parts in place.</p>\n\n<h2>Go forth and show some &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3</h2>\n\n<p>Keeping your code clean pays itself forward in many way. The team you\nare apart of or the team you are handing off to will thank you. Heck,\nyour future self might thank you. The patterns I&#39;ve described here are\nones that I have found success with.

With the release of\nRails 3.2.0 I&#39;ve decided to start extracting out all of the non-Rails\ncomponents, such as SimpleForm support and Mongoid support, into their\nown gems. I want to disucss my reasons for doing this as I believe this\npath of modularity is going to mean better gem maintenance, more frequent\nreleases, and the opportunity for the community to really get involved.</p>\n\n<p>Last night I released ClientSideValidations-3.2.0.beta.1 and I have extracted the following into their own gems:</p>\n\n<h5>ORMs</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/client_side_validations-mongoid\">ClientSideValidations-Mongoid</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/client_side_validations-mongo_mapper\">ClientSideValidations-MongoMapper</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>FormBuilders</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/client_side_validations-formtastic\">ClientSideValidations-Formtastic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/client_side_validations-simple_form\">ClientSideValidations-SimpleForm</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Going Modular</h2>\n\n<p>The problem with keeping support for the many different ORMs and\nFormBuilders in the ClientSideValidations gem is that there are just too\nmany dependencies doing different things. A great example is with\nMongoid and <a href=\"https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations/issues/253\">ClientSideValidations Issue #253</a>.\nMongoid <code>2.4.0</code> added a <a href=\"https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid/blob/2.4.0-stable/lib/mongoid/validations/presence.rb\">PresenceValidator</a> instead of using\nthe ActiveModel version. This caused translations to fail as they were\nbeing served up directly from Mongoid instead of ActiveModel. I could\nhave fixed this easily in ClientSideValidations but now this means all\nfuture releases would require anyone using a version of Mongoid previous\nto this change to upgrade. There are many reason why you may not want to\nupgrade Mongoid, none of which are my business.</p>\n\n<p>Pulling the Mongoid code out into its own plugin allows this bug to be\nfixed there and I can continue to do bug fixes/feature development in\nClientSideValidations that everyone can benefit from.</p>\n\n<h2>More than just SemVer</h2>\n\n<p>The versions of the plugins now matter. I&#39;ve decided to\nmatch the library they are supporting&#39;s Major and Minor version. For\nexample, with Mongoid the current version is <code>2.4.x</code> so the current\nversion of <a href=\"https://github.com/dockyard/client_side_validations-mongoid\">ClientSideValidations-Mongoid</a>\nis <code>2.4.0</code>. All bug fixes for this version will only bump the patch\nversion. We can then go back and add a <code>2.3.0</code> version that does not\nexpect a Mongoid PresenceValidator and you won&#39;t need to change the\nversion of ClientSideValidations. Simple enough stuff, but it gives the\nlibrary a lot of flexibility.</p>\n\n<h2>Community Support</h2>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t go back and cover every single Major/Minor\nrelease of the different gems. I&#39;m starting with the current versions\nand going to look to the community to send pull-requests to fill in the\ngaps.</p>\n\n<p>With these ORM and FormBuilder gems the community should have a good\nstarting point for writing their own ClientSideValidations plugins.</p>\n\n<p>If someone is looking for a good starting point to build a gem you can\nstart with NestedForm as this is a gem that I did not extract and its\nsupport was dropped.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, I&#39;m looking for help. It would be nice to get some\nmaintainers on the plugins but I&#39;m also looking for someone to lend a\nhand with ClientSideValidations.</p>\n\n<h2>When will it be released?</h2>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve got a bunch of <a href=\"https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations/issues\">issues in\nClientSideValidations</a> I want to fix, I&#39;m\nguessing maybe a week or two to get through all of these. I&#39;ll go\nthrough a few <code>beta</code> gems then a release candidate or two. I am always open to community contributions. If you want to help, please do!</p>\n\n<p>You can start using this today with the beta version. All of the plugins\nrequire the beta version of ClientSideValidations 3.2.0.</p>\n\n<h2>The Future</h2>\n\n<p>Rails <code>3.2.0</code> will be the last <code>3.x</code> version of Rails, and so this will\nalso be the last <code>3.x</code> version of ClientSideValidations. Work is already\nunderway on the <code>4.x</code> version. One of the biggest changes is going to\nhappen on the JavaScript side. Client-side model validations will be the\ngoal. As well as compostite views for the error rendering. Ideally I\nwould like ClientSideValidations to be able to hook into the popular\nJavaScript MVC frameworks.</p>\n","summary":"Brian summarizes the changes to come in ClientSideValidations 3.2.0","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["ruby","ruby-on-rails","gems"],"date":"2012-01-22T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2012/01/04/its-not-a-vacation-follow-up","title":"It's Not A Vacation Follow Up","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>We have been pretty busy here at DockYard and I haven&#39;t had a chance to\nfollow up on the <a href=\"/2011/12/04/its-not-a-vacation.html\">previous post</a></p>\n\n<p>To recap: DockYard is a distributed team, we decided to switch it up for\na week and go to the same city and work our asses off.</p>\n\n<p>Result: We kicked ass.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/20120104/danandruss.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Pickett &amp; Russ Jones\"></p>\n\n<p>The city we chose to work from for the week is Providence, RI.

Here at DockYard we really hope this\nhappens. We believe in the mobile web and have decided forego regular\nweb application development in favor of focusing on mobile web\napplication development. However, experience has told us the future is not as nigh as we\nall hope.</p>\n\n<p>Native applications (iOS, Android, etc.) still have and will continue\nto have some significant advantages over mobile web apps. Let&#39;s start\nwith the obvious...</p>\n\n<h3>Native functionality</h3>\n\n<p>Having access to mobile hardware such as the camera, microphone, and\nstorage (file system, internal datbases, etc...) is important. There is also the issue\nof running the application in the background. None of this is currently\npossible in a mobile web application. Immediately the scope of a mobile\nweb application is much smaller.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html-media-capture/\">W3C has a working draft of what a media capture API should\nbe</a>. It may be a\nmatter of time until we see mobile browsers begin to provide access to\nthis native functionality. Personally, I would like to see this API\ndeveloped further. In its current form it is simply a delegator API to\nthe camera and microphone applications. We hand off application control and wait for a\ncallback that has the list of media just captured. This is not good\nenough. How can a mobile web application compete with the many\ndifferent native camera applications that exist with custom camera\nfunctionality if there is no way to\ncustomize the camera experience? Simple: it can&#39;t. Augmented reality\nmobile web application? Nope. What about something as simple as skinning\nthe camera? Not with the current working draft of the MediaCapture API.</p>\n\n<p>Most mobile web browsers implement the HTML canvas element. So mobile\nweb gaming is possible. But what we really want is hardware accelerated\nWebGL. It&#39;s not here yet. We&#39;re still waiting for the desktop\ncanvas apps to close the gap between their native desktop counterparts.\nMobile web gaming will not be competing with native mobile gaming\nanytime soon.</p>\n\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n\n<p>Native is the clear winner here but with each new generation of phone\nhardware the lead is becoming less noticeable. In fact, I&#39;m going to\npredict that in the 2nd half of 2012 (iPhone5, assuming Apple goes back\nto the previous iPhone release cycle) for everything\nexcept gaming, the difference will be negligible.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re getting closer and closer to the point of convergence. Hardware is\ngetting faster, JavaScript VMs are getting faster. Native and mobile web\napps will never be equally as fast, native will <strong>always</strong> be faster.\nWith each generation of mobile hardware we will care less because the gap will continue to get asymptotically\nsmaller.</p>\n\n<p>This current performance gap can be felt most with <a href=\"http://jquerymobile.com\">jQuery\nMobile</a>. We use jQuery Mobile, we believe in\nit. On the latest iPhone 4S there is still a noticeable lag when\ndoing page trasitions, even on mobile web applications that have very few\npages of low complexity. The page enhancement algorithm does <strong>a lot</strong> of\nDOM manipulation and hoop jumping. Elements are pulled out of the DOM,\nwrapped, reinserted. In the end it allows us to\nprovide very little markup and get some beautiful results.</p>\n\n<p>As of this writing jQuery Mobile is in 1.0 Release Candidate 2. On the bucket\nlist for 1.0 Gold is a <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2853\">performance boost for page enhancement</a>.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/jquerymobile/status/133670336318291969\">Most likely this will only have an effect upon very complex pages</a>.\nClosing the performance gap on jQuery Mobile is going to be a watershed\nmoment for mobile web application development.</p>\n\n<h3>Distribution</h3>\n\n<p>Nothing beats the web as a distribution platform. Every time I use a web\napp I am on the latest version of that app. If there are any business\ncritical updates they are immediately available for everybody. Native\nmobile applications are at a clear disadvantage here. We&#39;re comparing a\npassive opt-in system to an active apt-in system.</p>\n\n<p>One disadvantage (for now) that mobile web applications have is\naccessibility after distribution. Native apps default to installing on\nyour phone, mobile web applications do not. Yes, you can save links to\nthe mobile web app and make it appear you have it installed. But what\nabout off-line mode?</p>\n\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to argue that native applications win here. Finding a native\nmobile application is easier than finding a mobile web application.\nGoogle has made a large dent for the web with Chrome&#39;s Omnibar. (btw,\nwhy hasn&#39;t everybody copied the omnibar? This should be the default for mobile\nweb browsers, screen real estate is already at a premium.)</p>\n\n<p>That being said, discovery for native is not great. We&#39;ve\nall see the studies where the Top 10 apps have a significantly skewed\ndownload rate compared to the below Top 10. This is be expected. I don&#39;t\nunderstand why the mobile app stores have not put more effort into\nperfecting discovery. I&#39;m more likely to purchase an application that I\nlike if I can find it easily.</p>\n\n<h3>PhoneGap (Apache Callback)</h3>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve made it this far you&#39;ve probably been yelling at your screen\n&quot;<strong>PhoneGap!</strong>&quot; to several of the points I&#39;ve made above. Yes, PhoneGap solves many of these problems. But how do\nwe define a PhoneGap application? The technology stack I&#39;m using is that\nof a mobile web application: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. However, the\ndistribution and discovery systems I am using are that of a native\napplication. PhoneGap application straddle the fence between the two\nworlds.</p>\n\n<p>For those that don&#39;t know, PhoneGap extends a WebUI. It will add certain\nfunctionality to the JavaScript API. Access to the camera, microphone,\nfile system <a href=\"http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.2.0/index.html\">as well as many other wonderful features</a>.\nThe PhoneGap developers were smart, they saw the W3C&#39;s proposed API for\nsome of this and modeled the PhoneGap API after it. In fact, PhoneGap\nshould acts as a polyfill if certain functionality already exists.</p>\n\n<p>From a developer&#39;s point of view, PhoneGap in most cases should be a no\nbrainer. I am most likely developing a web site alongside the mobile\napplication. The website is likely going to be sharing the\nfunctionality of the mobile application. It makes sense if my\nmobile application can share a technology stack with my web application.\nI don&#39;t have to employ a separate team to develop the mobile\napplication, and if you want to target more than one mobile platform\nyou&#39;ll most likely have to employ more than one team.</p>\n\n<p>From our perspective PhoneGap gives us a\nhuge advantage. Why pay two teams to develop the same application when you\npay us once? Then when we hand off the team maintaining and developing\nyour website can also maintain and develop the mobile application. It&#39;s\na no-brainer. In most cases.</p>\n\n<p>There are some serious issues with the PhoneGap project. The first of\nwhich is the difficulty in reporting errors. This will hopefully change\nnow that the project is under Apache (as <a href=\"http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/46311152/apache-callback-proposal\">Apache Callback</a>)\nbut the project has been split into different Github repos for each\nplatform. So there is one for <a href=\"https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-iphone\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-android\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-wp7\">Windows Phone 7</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-blackberry-webworks\">BlackBerry</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-webos\">WebOS</a>, etc... they are all under separate development with very dedicated teams. If I find a common problem that affects all platforms (for example, <a href=\"https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-iphone/issues/280\">a suggestion I proposed on how PhoneGap currently implements its File API</a>) I have to report this issue individually on each platform. This is a very inefficient process.</p>\n\n<p>The second is the same issue stated above with the camera. While PhoneGap does give us the access to the camera we are still stuck\nwith the same experience we will have with the W3C MediaCapture API: no\ncamera customization, this is just a delegation with a callback. You can\nhack together the camera experience you want if decide to write some\nnative code.</p>\n\n<p>The third is lack of any background processing. When I throw my PhoneGap\napp into the background it does nothing. It would be nice if we could\nget a callback in the PhoneGap API that allowed us to kick off function\nif the app is sent to the background. When it is up front again give us\nanother callback to halt the previous function.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/36752779/PhoneGap%20Plugins\">Check out the &quot;Limitations&quot; section on the PhoneGap wiki for some\nothers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>PhoneGap is fantastic (despite some of the criticism I&#39;ve stated). We have\nhigh hopes for the project now that it is accepted into Apache.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps <a href=\"http://techland.time.com/2011/11/09/mobile-flash-abandoned-for-html5-adobe-surrenders-apple-wins/?iid=tl-main-lede\">Adobe&#39;s announcement that they are abandoning Flash in\nfavor of HTML5 for mobile</a> will be seen as the turning point when\nmobile web application development begins to be a serious contender to\nnative. Or maybe it is just a coincidence that this buzz is happening\nall at once. Either way, we&#39;re happy\npeople are talking about this. Discussions, arguments, and all of the\nattention in between are the best way to push this technology into the\nfuture we all know is just a matter of time.</p>\n\n<p>As my friend <a href=\"http://twitter.com/cykod\">Pascal Rettig</a> says: It is a great time to be a web developer.</p>\n","summary":"Brian summarizes DockYard's experience thus far with mobile web apps and some of the existing challenges to compete with native","illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["mobile","mobile-web"],"date":"2011-11-10T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"2011/08/24/launch","title":"DockYard is launched!","dockyarder":"brian-cardarella","body":"<p>DockYard has officially launched!</p>\n\n<p>Hoo-ray!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/hooraybeer.jpg\" alt=\"Hoo-ray!\"></p>\n","summary":null,"illustration":null,"illustration_alt":null,"tags":["announcement"],"date":"2011-08-24T00:00:00Z"}],
