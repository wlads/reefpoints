### The GitHub web interface way

* [Click here](https://github.com/dockyard/reefpoints/new/master/source/posts) to be brought to the new post page
* Title your file following the pattern `<date>-<title with dashes>.md`,
  an example of this would be `2015-01-01-my-awesome-blog-post.md`
* Add the following block to the beginning of the file, this block
  contains the meta data for the post:
```
---
layout: post
title: "My Awesome Blog post"
comments: true
social: true
author: Dan McClain
twitter: "_danmcclain"
github: danmcclain
summary: "A brief summary of your post"
published: true
tags: tags, separating each, with commas
---
```

* Place a new line underneath this meta data, and paste your content
* Scroll to the bottom, adding a commit message summary in the present
  tense `Adds my awesome blog post`
* Make this commit on a new branch by clicking the bottom radio button
  and giving the branch a name
